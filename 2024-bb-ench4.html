Bungalow: Roosters Crowing and Dogs Barking</h2>
<!-- l. 190 --><p class='noindent'>I find myself contemplating the auditory landscape experienced by
luxury tourists nestled in their extravagant overwater bungalows,
perched above the crystalline waters with the main island spread
before them—a picturesque tableau ideally only occasionally, but
realistically oftentimes obscured by wandering clouds. What sonic
fragments drift across the misty banks into these outrageously
expensive retreats?
</p><!-- l. 193 --><p class='indent'>   The dawn inevitably announces itself through a raucous
rooster symphony. During the entire night you can hear roosters
crowing, but it gets more intense at daybreak. These feathered
vocalists seem locked in an absurd competition, each attempting to
out-screech the others with piercing calls that puncture the
morning stillness. One can almost imagine them puffing out their
chests, each believing themselves the most accomplished herald of
daybreak.
</p><!-- l. 197 --><p class='indent'>   Accompanying this avian chorus is the persistent counterpoint
of dogs barking—a soundscape that, while perhaps less refined,
remains somewhat morew tolerable than the mechanical cacophony
one might encounter elsewhere. I cannot help but contrast this
with the thunderous boat engines that transform places like Railay
Beach in Thailand’s Krabi into sonic nightmares. Those
ubiquitous photographs of seemingly pristine, tourist-free beaches
raise intriguing questions. Are they the result of carefully
orchestrated photo sessions where beaches are temporarily
                                                        
                                                        
cleared? Or perhaps the magic of digital editing has simply
whisked away the human presence, creating an illusion of
untouched paradise.
</p><!-- l. 200 --><p class='indent'>   It seems improbable that the glossy marketing materials for
Bora Bora’s luxury resorts would candidly advertise: “Immerse
yourself in an authentic island soundscape—wake to the
melodious crowing of roosters, punctuated by the enthusiastic
barking of local dogs!” And yet, these sounds represent a genuine,
unfiltered slice of island life, far more authentic than any digitally
sanitized postcard view.
