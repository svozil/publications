Dear Editors,

thank you and the Referees for the care and attention dedicated to the manuscript.

I have taken some (hopefully most) of the concerns of the first Referee, and (hopefully) all the suggestions of the 4th Referee into account as follows:

Response to Reviewer 1:

The Reviewer kindly repeats my changes that, I have hoped, would improve readability and would make the argument more transparent.

Insofar the Reviewer disagrees with what I have stated I have tried to clarify the semantics of what I have in mind.

More explicitly, this disagreement is mentioned in the Reviewer's paragraph starting with

"Instead of an operational definition, the author then offers
Sec.II "EXAMPLES OF PROBABILISTIC CONTEXTUALITY"..."

In this paragraph the Reviewer argues as follows:

"... I did not look
into all that references, but those I have looked into do not
support any "probabilistic contextuality." E.g., Suppes and
Zanotti [25] in 1981 considered variable bounds for particular
combinations of probabilities that observables would have values
from {-1,1} but that does mean that any "probabilistic
contextuality" is involved, i.e., that "classically embeddable
observables, as well as classical probability distributions,
are allowed" for assignments from {-1,1}. The point is that in
a contextual set such an assignment is not possible and Suppes
and Zanotti's result does not enable any such classical
"probabilistic contextuality." ..."

With all due respect, I have to disagree with the Reviewer in this aspect; indeed the existence of a two-valued measure (indeed, multiple such measures) and the existence of an associated {-1,1}-value assignment is the exact point of my argument; in particular, also for the Suppes and Zanotti's result.

My recent analysis of Suppes and Zanotti's result (DOI 10.1007/s10773-021-04850-9) still allows *single* instances of {-1,1}-value assignments (a subject never denied by Suppes and Zanotti). But the classical probabilistic analysis of their interesting configuration reveals the bounds derived by Suppes and Zanotti, that are violated by the quantum probabilities of analogous quantized systems. These arguments have been brought forward for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt configuration by Asher Peres (DOI: 10.1119/1.11393).

Assuming that many Readers might raise similar concerns and objections as the Referee, I have added the following passage to the manuscript at the end of this section:

"Suppes and Zanotti's result~\cite{Suppes-81,svozil-2020-ex} as well as other bounds on classical probabilities for different configurations of observables
still allow {\em single} instances of $\{-1,1\}$-value assignments, as the respective set of two-valued states is not empty (as for Kochen-Specker configurations).
But the classical probabilistic analysis of such configurations reveals that the bounds on classical probabilities
are violated by the quantum probabilities of analogous quantized systems.
This has been explicitly and constructively demonstrated  by tabulations of classical  $\{-1,1\}$-value assignments
for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt configuration~\cite{chsh} by Asher Peres~\cite{peres222}.
Further quantitative investigations into the ``amount'', or a measure, of probabilistic contextuality
in terms of enumerations and tabellations of classical value assignments have, for instance,
been studied in References~\cite{svozil_2010-pc09,svozil-2011-enough,Dzhafarov-2015,Dzhafarov-2017,KujalaDzhafarov-2019,Dzhafarov-19PhysRevA}."

I have also greatly expanded the definition section on "Notation", as well as included four concrete examples:

(i) A concrete tabellation and discussion of classical simultaneous {-1,1} values for the Suppes-Zanotti configuration;

(ii) A concrete enumeration of a functional contextuality, the "Specker bug" gadget whose hypergraph representation of contexts is depicted in Figure 1;

(iii) A concrete enumeration of strong contextuality by the Kochen and Specker "combo" whose hypergraph representation of contexts is depicted in Figure 2;

(iv) A concrete enumeration of strong contextuality by a set of observables supporting no unital set of two-valued states is depicted in Figure 3.,

that should improve comprehension of the subject.


Response to Reviewer 4:

In the beginning of the Report, the Referee so nicely summarises the paper that I have used a (slightly modified) version of this summary and included it at the end of the paper:

"\section{Summary}

Numerous notions of contextuality exist in the literature on quantum foundations.
The concept of ``contextuality'' is often used in ambiguous or contradictory ways.
This paper has taken a logic-based approach to clarify, identify, and categorize these different notions.
In particular, we propose to categorize different notions of contextuality into two major groups:
probabilistic and strong notions of contextuality.
We suggest using Kochen and Specker's demarcation Theorem~0~\cite{kochen1} as a criterion to differentiate between those groups."

As the Referee agrees with Referee 1 that there is a lack of clarity of the argument; and four concrete examples are lacking from the paper's exposition, I have included the following examples now:

(i) A concrete tabellation and discussion of classical simultaneous {-1,1} values for the Suppes-Zanotti configuration;

(ii) A concrete enumeration of a functional contextuality, the "Specker bug" gadget whose hypergraph representation of contexts is depicted in Figure 1;

(iii) A concrete enumeration of strong contextuality by the Kochen and Specker "combo" whose hypergraph representation of contexts is depicted in Figure 2;

(iv) A concrete enumeration of strong contextuality by a set of observables supporting no unital set of two-valued states is depicted in Figure 3.

These examples wil hopefully will contribute towards a clarification of some of the issues discussed.

Here is my response to the seven issues that the 4th Referee considered in need to be seriously addressed, one-by-one:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) The main suggestion of the paper is to categorise contextuality into two cases, that are
termed probabilistic and strong contextuality. However, it is very difficult to extract a
formal understanding of what these notions are, as they are defined very implicitly and
rather informally. Given their central role, I think these need to be clearly and formally
defined. It is also important to clarify the relation between these notions (does one imply
the other?)

Response to 1) I have, on many occations tried to stree state the central criterion id embeddability of the set of quantum observables into supposedly ``larger'' boolean algebras, while maintaining the logico-algebraic structure.

I have added parts of a sentence in the abstract: "... in terms of non-classical probability distributions, while still maintaining classical representability of the quantum observables."

I have also added an introductory paragraph as follows:

"The main point of this paper will be to argue that there are at least two main types of contextuality: the first notion is based upon nonclassical phenomenology,
and in particular, on nonclassical probabilities contradicting Boole's conditions of physical experience~\cite{Boole-62}.
The second type goes beyond this,
and is based upon the absence of a classical logico-algebraic structure in terms of which the respective observables could be re-interpreted.
Formally this amounts to nonembaddability into Boolean algebras by classical means; that is, in formal terms,
by two-valued measures interpretable as classical truth assignments. The strongest form of this latter logico-algebraic contextuality
is the total absence of any such classical truth assignment~\cite{kochen1}.
Thereby, it is important to keep in mind that the mere existence of any such classical truth assignment
is necessary but not sufficient to ensure classical representability or embeddability:
indeed, even if there is an apparent ``abundance'' of classical truth assignments, these might
not provide sufficient means to classically embed a collection of quantum observables."

I have added a sentence explaining omni-existence:

"Omni-realism or omni-existence is the insistance that, although due to complementarity not all observables can be measured simultaneously, they are nevertheless value definite;
that is, some of them must have a definite counterfactual value that can by no physical means be measuremed~\cite{specker-60}."

~~~~~~~~~~~

2) The decision to make this distinction seems to be based on the logical difference
between the notions. This is an interesting approach, but I would like to see it justified
further from a physical point of view. In particular, it is not so clear to me why, from a
physical point of view, it is relevant that some observables "allow classical
probabilities, but those probabilities are not realized by the [...] systems at hand." In
either case (probabilistic or strong contextuality), the physical objects don't admit of a
classical non-contextual model, so why does it matter what kind of models they *don't*
allow?

Response to 2)

I have modified one paragraph and added another one:

"Why should one make such a distinction from a physical point of view?
Because if there do not exist separating sets of two-valued states and thus no faithful classical embeddability
then the respective structures do not any longer support classical probability distributions;
and also no ``hidden variables'' in terms of the ``larger'' extended Boolean algebra in which the observables can be homomorphically embedded.
This is quite different from any non-classical probability distribution on an otherwise ``quasi-classical''  empirical logics~\cite{Foulis1976}
containing complementary observables that can still be imbedded into ``larger'' extended Boolean algebras.

For physical realizations we refer to Wright's generalized urn models~\cite{wright} or the initial state identification problem
for finite automata~\cite{e-f-moore,schaller-96}, amounting to partition logics~\cite{svozil-2001-eua}.
The resulting empirical logics~\cite{Foulis1976} are identical to the quantum propositional structures~\cite{birkhoff-36}
we shall discuss in those instances of ``weak'' quantum contextuality that we term probabilistic.
These logics support both classical as well as quantum probabilities.
Which probability distribution needs to be chosen depends solely on the respective physical realization~\cite{svozil-2018-b}.
In particular, there is no structural logicaldistinction; the difference is in their performance.
In such cases classical ``hidden variables'' cannot be ruled out."

With regard to the Reviewer's question: "In
either case (probabilistic or strong contextuality), the physical objects don't admit of a
classical non-contextual model, so why does it matter what kind of models they *don't*
allow?"  --- one needs to emphasise that in the case of probabilistic contextuality classical non-contextual model cannot be ruled out.
Indeed, this is one of my concerns with this type of contextuality.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3) In the literature, a distinction is often made between state dependent and state
independent contextuality. What is the relation of this to the types of contextuality
described in the present article? It also seems to me that the distinction between strong
and probabilistic contextuality has already been made in the literature (e.g.,
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03521.pdf, Eq. (4.1)). How does this relate to what this paper
is defining? If the notions are not the same, then why should these terms be defined in one
way rather than the other? More generally, the paper should probably be better embedded in
the modern contextuality literature. Many papers are cited, but the majority of these are
rather old (there are very few references from the last 10 years, excepting those involving
the author and some philosophical references).

Response to 3)

I hesitate to include both "state independent contextuality" as well as contextuality discussed by Prof. Samson Abramsky because the article is already in danger of taking too many side steps. I have, nevertheless, quoted Cabello's early paper on this in the introduction by saying "(i) either merely assume the omni-existence of unrestricted classical noncontextual value assignments that do not depend on the complete disposition of the apparatus [15];"

The first approach of "state independent contextuality" is not based on two-valued measures, but insted ventures into non-admissible yet non-contextual value assignments. I agree that this might have some relevance, but it would not contribute to the demarcation criterium.

I also agree that Prof. Samson Abramsky's approach is fascinating. Yet it is in many ways a reformulation of the findings in quantum logic, such as the theorems by Specker, and Kochen & Specker.

Therefore I hope that the Reviewer will forgive my not mentioning these interesting approaches.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4) The paper has two sections on "examples of [probabilistic/strong] contextuality", but
these sections appear rather to be literature surveys rather than examples. To understand
the notions presented, it would help a lot to have some concrete examples actually
presented in the paper, rather than simply cited. It might help to rework the structure of
the paper a little. For example, by (for each notion of contextuality) first defining it
formally, then giving some concrete examples, then discussing how it fits with the
literature.

Resonse to 4)

I have added now two respective examples, as suggested by the Referee.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5) The claim that, in the literature, omni-existence is often taken for granted is, I
believe, somewhat misleading. Just because it is assumed for the sake of contradiction
doesn't necessarily mean contextuality is generally interpreted as the existence of a
contextual hidden variable model, as seems to be claimed in the introduction. Indeed, these
days, contextuality is primarily taken, at least formally, to mean the non-existence of a
noncontextual model (see, e.g., the recent review https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13036).
Indeed, the way it is interpreted is often somewhat inconsistent, leading to many of the
issues this paper tries to address, but I would avoid imposing interpretations on others as
much as possible, as this compounds, rather than helps, the problem.

Response to 5) Here I am a little bit of a loss. I knwo Cabello's work quite well (I even co-authored a paper with him), but I believe that he would agree with me.

Take, for instance, his "state independent contextuality" paper DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.210401 which he begins with "Because of the lack of spacelike separation between one
observer’s choice and the other observer’s outcome, the immense majority of the experimental violations of Bell inequalities does not prove quantum nonlocality, but just
quantum contextuality." --- which basically boils down to probabilistic contextuality.

Abbott, Calude (earlier Conder) and myself have developed a notion of contextuality that does not require total omni-existence of value assignments but allows for
partial functions in the sense of Kleene; and I have discussed this in some depth.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

6) Some of the claims in the discussion need to be backed up further. For example, it is
not really clear to me what the "concerns about a method of collapsing probabilities" is
(or at least, why they're problematic), and the comment on contextuality supplying the
magic in quantum computation appears unmerited (at the least the claims should be cited;
the papers I imagine the author has in mind are, from a formal point of view, clear). In
Sec. IVA, the author argues against one particular interpretation of the KS contradiction
as being unjustified, before suggesting an alternative interpretation that (by the very
same reasons) appears no more justified to me. It is alost unclear for me what the term
"haunted" refers to in IVB.

Responsae to 6)

I have eliminated the paragraph discussing "collapsing probabilities" as it may have been distractive.

"Haunted contextuality" is again the idea that there exists no direct, only indirect empirical tests invoking counterfactuals of this concept.
I have mentionedit because I have been asked by Professor Khrennikov and others to include this issue in a discussion recently.
I have added the sentence:

"It should be kept in mind that there exists no direct, only indirect empirical tests invoking counterfactuals of this concept."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

7) Finally, the paper users many terms that are not standard in the literature, and often
phrases things in particularly complicated ways. An effort should be made to simplify the
language to improve clarity throughout.

Response to 7) I have carefully revised and polished some passages in order to improve readability, and streamline the subject.

I have, for instance, changed the title to "Varieties of contextuality based on probability and structural nonembeddability"
to emphasize this important point from the onset.  Also, the abstract has been rewritten with this in mind.

In a new "nomenclature" section the notion of context and two-valued measures are formally defined by using "admissibility", a notion that has been put forward by Professor Calude in whose honour this special volume of TCS is dedicated.

I hope with these revisions the paper can be accepted.

Thank you and the Referees for their kind attention and efforts dedicated to this manuscript.

With kind regards,

Karl Svozil
