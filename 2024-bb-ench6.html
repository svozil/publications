American Hotel Chain</h2>
<!-- l. 217 --><p class='noindent'>That evening, my attempt to inflate the air mattress ends in total
defeat. This mattress clearly demands a pump—unless one
wishes to risk a catastrophic stroke from manual inflation! My
hotel proves utterly unhelpful, lacking even a simple bicycle
pump.
</p><!-- l. 219 --><p class='indent'>   The neighboring establishment rents out decrepit, rust-eaten
bicycles for around 13 Euros daily and possesses a pump—but it is
a pitiful excuse for inflation equipment. Reluctantly, the owner
emerges with the pump. Her attempts prove disastrous; she
comprehends neither the mattress valve’s intricate mechanism nor
the delicate art of inflation. Missing an entire pump arm and
compatible with only one valve type, the device seems more a
relic of mechanical failure than a functional tool. I feel a genuine
pity for the owner of such a sorry enterprise.
</p><!-- l. 224 --><p class='indent'>   After several futile attempts, I abandon hope. At this
point the mattress seems destined to remain a flat, useless
rectangle.
</p><!-- l. 226 --><p class='indent'>   Salvation arrives unexpectedly from a nearby hotel—an
international chain with distinctly American origins. In their repair
shed, I find unexpected assistance. An employee immediately
abandons his tasks, retrieving a compressor from another storage
area. The machine roars to life, yet initially fails to inflate the
mattress. The young worker struggles, pressing the hose against
the valve with such misguided enthusiasm that he effectively seals
                                                        
                                                        
the air’s escape route.
</p><!-- l. 228 --><p class='indent'>   Fortunately, an older employee—clearly the junior’s
supervisor—intervenes. With practiced ease, he connects an
appropriate valve to the compressor. A first attempt fails as air
escapes through two suspicious holes. In a moment of desperation,
I take control. Gripping the holes tightly over the valve, I create an
impromptu seal. Suddenly, the mattress inflates with remarkable
speed.
</p><!-- l. 230 --><p class='indent'>   Triumphant grins spread across everyone’s faces. I offer
heartfelt thanks and head toward the sea, my hard-won air mattress
in tow. Once again, an American company has rescued me from
potential disaster—a recurring theme, as future stories will
reveal.
