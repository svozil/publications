Knife from Namibia</h2>
<!-- l. 234 --><p class='noindent'>I do not intend to dwell too much on the topic of coconuts, but I
will say this much: in Vaitape, I had the pleasure of enjoying a
delicious, plump coconut for a reasonable price of 300 Pacific
Francs (about two and a half Euros). It was purchased and
opened by an older gentleman, who made the process look
effortless.
</p><!-- l. 236 --><p class='indent'>   However, my experiences with the coconuts found scattered on
the beaches, fallen from the palm trees, have been far less
enjoyable. While it is easy enough to pick one up, opening
it is an entirely different matter. Back home, I manage to
cut through the first fibrous layer, and then, with the help
of a corkscrew and a sharp point, I manage to drill a hole
into the coconut. But the watery liquid that escapes is a pale
imitation of what I enjoyed in Vaitape, both in taste and
in quantity. The yield is far smaller, and the liquid, though
refreshing, lacks the full flavor of the fresh coconut. In the
end, I discard the coconut I brought back from the beach,
a sad reminder of the disparity between expectations and
reality.
</p><!-- l. 238 --><p class='indent'>   By the way, these falling coconuts are not without danger. I
can already picture the headline in an Austrian tabloid: “Viennese
Pensioner Killed by a Coconut on Bora Bora!”
