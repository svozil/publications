<!-- l. 461 --><p class='noindent'>The construction of paradise through the Pacific island world,
embodied here in Bora Bora, succeeds only partially. The island’s
neglect is palpable: shabby shacks dot the landscape, while
oppressive humidity induces instant perspiration with no respite.
Roosters pierce the hot nights with their strident calls, and a
cacophony of canine sounds accompanies them—packs of dogs
emerging from driveways, blocking paths with threatening
postures, teeth bared and growls menacing.
</p><!-- l. 465 --><p class='indent'>   In short: If this is Bora Bora’s paradise, then I long for
nirvana!
</p><!-- l. 467 --><p class='indent'>   The weather proves maddeningly capricious. During the rainy
season, a two-week vacation can dissolve into an endless grey
tableau.
</p><!-- l. 469 --><p class='indent'>   I observed two Americans wading halfheartedly through the
shallow lagoon, the sky a solid canopy of clouds obscuring the sun
since early afternoon. Their expressions betrayed a universal
disappointment: Is this why we traveled halfway across the
world?
</p><!-- l. 473 --><p class='indent'>   Yet when the sun finally emerges, both locals and tourists
justifiably speak of paradisiacal conditions—provided one can
endure the scorching heat. The lagoon transforms into a
mesmerizing canvas: azure blue deepening with water depth,
white-green shallows giving way to profound blue expanses. One
becomes enveloped in a surreal luminescence, surrounded by what
poets might call “everywhere and forever the distance shines
bright and blue”!
