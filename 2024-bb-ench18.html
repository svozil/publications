<!-- l. 432 --><p class='noindent'>The Society Islands are divided into two subgroups: the Leeward
Islands, which include Bora Bora, Raiatea, Taha’a, Huahine, and
Maupiti, and the Windward Islands, which encompass Moorea,
Tahiti, and Tetiaroa.
</p><!-- l. 434 --><p class='indent'>   I visited two of these islands: Tahiti, with its extension
Tahiti-Iti, where the international airport Fa’a’a is located
near the capital Papeete, and Moorea, a short ferry ride from
Papeete.
</p><!-- l. 436 --><p class='indent'>   I circumnavigated the largest island, Tahiti, twice. First, I took
two buses for a basic overview. For some inexplicable reason,
there are no buses that fully circle the island. Instead, two buses
each travel halfway around the island in opposite directions, and
passengers must transfer at the common terminus in Taravao.
Taravao is also home to a giant Carrefour supermarket.
</p><!-- l. 438 --><p class='indent'>   From Taravao, you can explore the smaller island of Tahiti-Iti,
which is separated from Tahiti by a narrow isthmus. Unlike the
main island, Tahiti-Iti cannot be completely circumnavigated.
</p><!-- l. 440 --><p class='indent'>   The coastal ring road of Tahiti can easily be traveled in one
day, even with a few stops at tourist attractions such as a water
hole, a giant waterfall, and various parks and caves. I did this the
following day with a rental car, which seemed a bit expensive but
worth it.
</p><!-- l. 442 --><p class='indent'>   Once you venture inland, you’re immediately met with an
impenetrable rainforest. The jungle is thick and wild, with only a
few poor roads leading into it. The coastal road itself is lined
with homes that appear somewhat rundown—after all, not
                                                        
                                                        
everyone wants to show the side of their house facing the main
road.
</p><!-- l. 444 --><p class='indent'>   Near Papeete, I found a lovely beach, though a sign warned of
jellyfish. Despite the warning, many young people were out
surfing the heavy waves. Before reaching the beach, I passed an
avenue of mango trees, their fruits scattered on the ground in
various stages of ripeness and decay.
</p><!-- l. 447 --><p class='indent'>   I did not come across any other beaches that were inviting
enough to swim at. Indeed, after circling the island twice, I felt I
had seen enough.
</p><!-- l. 449 --><p class='indent'>   Moorea remains unforgettable to me because of an unexpected
downpour I encountered, completely unprepared. I hitchhiked and
then walked a nicely laid out path to the Belvedere viewpoint,
where I could see two bays with a massive mountain rock
formation in between. I got only moderately wet during the light
drizzle, and the path was interesting—it led through indigenous
settlements, which steamed in the thick, tropical vegetation.
Afterward, I visited another viewpoint with palm trees and a swing
hanging from two of those trees.
</p><!-- l. 452 --><p class='indent'>   Despite warnings from a local French cyclist, who advised me
to return to the valley due to the weather, I decided to ignore his
advice. My online hiking map showed a direct route along a
wooded mountainside leading to the ferry.
</p><!-- l. 454 --><p class='indent'>   This decision proved problematic: The path was partially
washed out, longer than expected, and became a muddy trail due
to the heavy rain. In the middle of my hike, the downpour
intensified, and the trail became so slippery I was sliding around.
Luckily, two local youths noticed me and did not just pass
by. They stayed with me, guiding me carefully down to the
                                                        
                                                        
valley.
</p><!-- l. 456 --><p class='indent'>   After a final, perilous slide down a steep, mud-covered slope, I
made it safely to the ferry. My fisherman’s hat, however, was lost
somewhere in the water, but that was a small sacrifice considering
what could have happened!
