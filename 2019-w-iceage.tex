On  Monday September 11th,
Walter Cronkite on {\em CBS} television stated,\cite{Cronkite-1972}
{\em ``British professor Hubert Lam says that a
new ice age is creeping over the
northern hemisphere
$\ldots$
even then it won't
be as bad as the last ice age 60,000
years ago then New York Cincinnati St.~Louis were under 5,000 feet of ice.
Presumably no traffic moved and school
was let out for the day. And that's the
way it is Monday September 11th, 1972.''}


On January 5th, 1978 Walter Sullivan  reported in {\em The New York Times},\cite{Sullivan-1978}
{\em An international team of specialists has concluded from eight indexes of climate that there is no end in sight to the cooling trend of the last 30 years,
at least in the Northern Hemisphere.}
