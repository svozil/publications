Sign of Physical Strength or Poor Nutrition?</h2>
<!-- l. 244 --><p class='noindent'>A commentary from in a respected publication notes that the
parliamentary opposition of the island nation has described
the health situation as “catastrophic”. Indeed, I have never
encountered such widespread obesity anywhere, across both
genders.
</p><!-- l. 246 --><p class='indent'>   Remarkably, the physical differences between men and
women—or indeed, between different gender identities—are often
hard to discern due to the overwhelming presence of body
mass. Gender is usually only identifiable by clothing. We
are fast approaching the Rae-Raes, which will be discussed
later.
</p><!-- l. 248 --><p class='indent'>   This obesity is further exacerbated by the oppressive heat and
a general reluctance to hide or downplay the extra pounds.
Indefinable bulges of fat sit in the water along the beach, a stark
contrast to the idyllic surroundings.
