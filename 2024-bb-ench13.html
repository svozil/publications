<!-- l. 368 --><p class='noindent'>Speaking of a place in the sun: A friend from Upper Austria
recently asked me why there’s no one on the beach in my
photos—are the beaches here really empty?
</p><!-- l. 370 --><p class='indent'>   When the sun shines on Matira Beach, it is so intense that it
becomes nearly impossible to sunbathe for long. To quote Albert
Camus again: the beach is “black with sun”.
</p><!-- l. 372 --><p class='indent'>   What is possible, however, is drifting around in the lagoon’s
water. On one hand, the water temperature is about 28°C when
overcast, and it gets even warmer when the sun is out. When the
sun beats down all day, the water near the shore becomes almost
too hot, prompting me to wade into slightly deeper areas where the
water reaches my navel. The buoyancy is so great that competitive
swimming feels almost impossible.
</p><!-- l. 374 --><p class='indent'>   Obese locals, seemingly unaffected by the heat, sometimes sit
with only their lower bodies submerged in the water, gossiping
with their boyfriends or girlfriends.
