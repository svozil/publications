Bora Bora</h2>
<!-- l. 90 --><p class='noindent'>The rain begins softly at 6 a.m. in Papeete, then intensifies
steadily. By the time we board the ferry <span class='ptmri7t-x-x-120'>Apetahi Express</span>, it has
become a full-blown downpour. A pervasive gloom, driven by
massive rolling waves and an unbroken expanse of gray clouds,
dominates the atmosphere. During one of the first stops in
Huahine, I see locals with umbrellas; some resign themselves to
the rain, allowing themselves to get drenched as they greet their
relatives or guests. One scene stands out—a grandmother,
beaming with joy as she warmly welcomes a young man with a
<span class='ptmri7t-x-x-120'>lei</span>, the traditional Polynesian flower necklace. Both are utterly
soaked in the process, their cheerful reunion undiminished by the
downpour.
</p><!-- l. 95 --><p class='indent'>   A friend in Auckland, upon receiving some videos of my
passage through the wild, rumbling, grayish ocean under an
equally gray, stormy sky, texts me back rather annoyed, asking me
not to send any more videos of that sort. He has had more than
enough of this weather back in New Zealand—and, as it turns out,
will have to endure much more to come.
</p><!-- l. 98 --><p class='indent'>   The sea remains turbulent until we reach Raiatea, the
second-to-last stop. As we pass Taha’a, the final island before
Bora Bora, the Polynesian universe feels enveloped in gloom and
cloud—a stark contrast to the glossy brightness and endless bluish
expanses depicted in postcards and podcasts.
</p><!-- l. 100 --><p class='indent'>   Approaching Bora Bora, the island looms as a dark
                                                        
                                                        
silhouette against lighter clouds, evoking memories of
Austria’s Salzkammergut region—a South Sea version of
alpine melancholy. The scene stirs recollections of 1986,
descending into Moscow’s overcast skies aboard a Hungarian
Malev plane. Clouds blanketed everything—a universe of
gray!
</p><!-- l. 103 --><p class='indent'>   Holidaymakers often arrive in Bora Bora drenched and
bedraggled, resembling “drowned poodles”. In this whimsical
sense, Bora Bora morphs into the <span class='ptmri7t-x-x-120'>Sound of Music</span>-laden
Salzkammergut or a grim Moscow, and vice versa—all merging
into a watery tapestry of somber experiences.
</p><!-- l. 106 --><p class='indent'>   Vaitape, the island’s main town, cannot be reached directly
from Raiatea or Taha’a, as the ship would risk running aground on
the edges of their reefs. BBora Bora’s main island reclines lazily,
like a bather in a warm tub, encircled by smaller islets known as
<span class='ptmri7t-x-x-120'>motus </span>and a jagged stretch of broken coral forming a protective
reef. A coral reef surrounds the island, creating a tranquil
lagoon.
</p><!-- l. 110 --><p class='indent'>   These <span class='ptmri7t-x-x-120'>motus </span>and the reef create a nearly perfect ring, similar to
Mauritius but unlike Hawaii or New Zealand. Inside the lagoon,
the waters remain calm. Outside, the Pacific roars with untamed
force. The reef is never far away—from any vantage point on the
main island, you can see the distant spray as waves crash against
it. Albert Camus might have described it as “the sea releasing its
dogs”. But these waves are not the Mediterranean’s gentle laps;
they are towering, rolling mountains of the wild South Seas!
From my hotel, their thunderous growls and snapping are
ever-present, restrained by the reef’s firm grip. Even in daylight,
their spray rises high, creating a perpetual white mist on the
                                                        
                                                        
horizon.
</p><!-- l. 113 --><p class='indent'>   The lagoon has an inlet and outlet, a single opening in the reef
situated in front of Vaitape, the island’s main town on the west
side. Entering the lagoon requires a journey along the southwest
reef, ultimately leading to Vaitape.
</p><!-- l. 115 --><p class='indent'>   As we near the lagoon’s entrance, heavy clouds cling to Mont
Otemanu, the island’s central volcanic peak, creating an ominous
spectacle. The sight resembles a colossal mushroom cloud or the
aftermath of a volcanic eruption. Dark clouds churn above Mont
Otemanu like a swirling mass of volcanic ash or a radioactive
plume.
</p><!-- l. 117 --><p class='indent'>   <img alt='PIC' src='image-20231213_132128-contentaware-rotated-A4.jpg' />
</p><!-- l. 119 --><p class='indent'>   Once inside the atoll, a surprising calm prevails. The ferry
glides into dock smoothly, as if it had never endured the ferocious
waves of the South Sea.
</p><!-- l. 121 --><p class='indent'>   I leave the icy, over-air-conditioned ship’s cabin and am
immediately enveloped by the steamy, warm, and humid tropical
air. Sweat beads on my skin almost instantly.
</p><!-- l. 123 --><p class='indent'>   To my surprise, no one seems to be awaiting my arrival. I
circle the jetty repeatedly until a plump lady—almost all the
women here are plump to varying degrees—finally locates me.
She ushers me and my luggage onto a bus with wooden benches
and a sturdy, wood-framed chassis. It is comfortably filled with
many arrivals from my boat, though not overcrowded. During the
transfer to the hotel, I awkwardly insist on buying a phone card,
which, according to my online research, should be available
en route to Matira Beach. As the aforementioned plump
lady astutely predicted, this proves to be a futile endeavor:
the shop in question has long since been converted into a
                                                        
                                                        
bar.
</p><!-- l. 128 --><p class='indent'>   To my delight, the hotel offers excellent internet connectivity,
allowing me to stay in touch with the broader world. A
4500-kilometer-long Honotua optical fiber submarine cable links
Vaitape in Bora Bora to Papeete and onward to Hawaii’s Big
Island. This connection, maintained by the US network operator
Hurricane Electric LLC, provides my current link to Europe and
the USA. Connections to Auckland in New Zealand also route via
Hawaii, facilitated by DRFortress, LLC in Honolulu. Additionally,
the 3600-kilometer-long Manatua One Polynesia Cable connects
Bora Bora to the Cook Islands, further enhancing the region’s
connectivity.
