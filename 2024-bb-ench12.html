Germans Wanted “A Place in the Sun” There Too</h2>
<!-- l. 354 --><p class='noindent'>In the 19th century, the then remaining dominating maritime
colonial powers, Great Britain and France, divided some of the
last paradisiacal corners of our planet through tough negotiations.
Oil and energy were not yet a major concern. Those fortunate
enough to be “neutralized” by these powers were spared from
direct colonization. Bora Bora, much like Hawaii, initially
remained neutral in this regard. However, the colonial powers
treated the indigenous population as astutely described by
Brecht: “When it rained and they encountered a new race, be it
brown or pale, they might make their beefsteak tartare out of
it”.
</p><!-- l. 356 --><p class='indent'>   This system held until other states started asserting their
claims. The United States, in the case of Hawaii, was far too
powerful to be challenged without significant losses. Germany, in
particular, began pushing into the remaining territories and
forgotten corners of the world, such as German South West Africa,
now known as Namibia. In a speech to the Reichstag on December
6, 1897, Bernhard von Bülow made Germany’s intentions clear:
“We do not wish to overshadow anyone, but we demand our place
in the sun”. He likely included Polynesian islands like Bora Bora
in his expansionist vision.
</p><!-- l. 358 --><p class='indent'>   However, France had already taken precautions. Bora Bora,
known locally as “Pora Pora,” was annexed on April 17, 1888,
and the last queen, Teriimaevarua III, was allowed to “rule”
                                                        
                                                        
until 1895. After her abdication, she kept her court until her
death, but the French replaced her with a bureaucrat who
adopted the title of vice president. Thus, there was no need
for a reconquista after the German ambitions were swiftly
diminished from the outset, colliding with the Franco-Polynesian
reefs.
</p><!-- l. 362 --><p class='indent'>   Since then, French has been the official language, with
occasional Polynesian expressions, such as “maruuru” for “thank
you”.
