Research goals


Produce a survey review article on coding strategies of various companies.


Noise types:

Which types of stochasticity: brownian, fractal, CCITT or white?

How does the client experience different noise types?



Stochastic interference:

Implementation of stochastic interference with multielectrode setup.

What is the reason of nerve activity? Can fractality be deduced from it?


Strategies:

First use multielectrode configuration simultaneously (all or a few the same signal)

Then, switch to fine resolution and multiple electrode coding (different stochastic signals
for different electrodes)
