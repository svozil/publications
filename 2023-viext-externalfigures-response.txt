Dear Staff of the Editorial Support at Scientific Reports,

I received another email with the following statement:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technical Check of your submission has now taken place. As a result, we need you to address the following points before your manuscript can progress any further:

1. We notice that tables has been referenced in the main text of your manuscript file but this table has not been included with your submission. Please either include this table in your manuscript file in an editable Word or TeX/LaTex format along with its legend or update the references to this table in the main text of your manuscript accordingly.
2. Please provide figure file in pdf format or in documents format in the system.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) With reference to 1:

If it is the previous wordings

"Tables I and II and Figure 2 in [9], also appearing in Figure 4."   and "An explicit construction of such a configuration has been presented in an earlier publication~\cite{2015-AnalyticKS}, which will be reviewed later."

then this passage refers to a reference, namely [9], and Tables I and II are NOT in the current manuscript but in paper Nr. 9.

In any case, the wording has been changed to

"An explicit construction of such a configuration has been presented in~\cite{2015-AnalyticKS}."

Now no (external) tables are mentioned, except in the \cite[Table ..}{...} statements.

May I kindly ask you, if you find that the "table" issue persist, to please let us know THE EXACT ISSUE. We are, at present, not aware of any issues with "tables": THERE IS NO TABLE IN THE ENTIRE MANUSCRIPT.

2) With reference to 2:

As in the previous submissions ALL FIGURE FILES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN PDF FORM IN THE ZIP FILE SUBMITTED, so we do not understand this error.

In any case, if these issues persist, we kindly ask you for a more detailed explanation, so that we can correct them.

Thank you for your attention and efforts!

With kind regards,

Karl Svozil

Dear Professor Hosseini,

Thank you and the two Reviewers for the evaluation of our manuscript.

In response to the feedback provided by the Editor and Reviewer 2, we have diligently revised our manuscript.
Specifically, we have amalgamated Sections I and II as suggested, while retaining the Nomenclature in what is now Section II.
By merging these sections,  we aimed to enhance the overall organization and coherence of our paper,
emphasizing its main topic and motivation more effectively.


Reviewer 2 suggested:

"1) The introduction should be well organized. The introduction in the draft is too short. The Sec.II and Sec.III maybe included in the introduction."

We have, as already mentioned, merged Sections I and II and left the nomenclature in (what is now) Section II.

In merging those two sections we have attempted to improve the organization of both sections, and stress the main topic and motivation for this paper.

"2) The main scheme is presented in Sec.IV , but it is too long. It is advisable to add a secondary heading so that the reader can understand it more clearly."

We have done exactly that: we added a secondary heading on "principles" and an "example" of (now) Section III.

We hope that, with these two amendments, the paper can be published.

Once again, we express our gratitude to you and the Referees for your and their kind evaluations and suggestions; they are very much appreciated and strengthen the presentation.

With kind regards,

Karl Svozil (in coordination with the first author, Christian S. Calude)
