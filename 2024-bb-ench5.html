as a Kilo of Locally Grown Tomatoes</h2>
<!-- l. 206 --><p class='noindent'>I survey the swimming equipment offerings at the two supermarkets
and the surprisingly expansive clothing store near Matira
Beach—not in Vaitape itself, but close by. The larger supermarket
displays an inflatable life buoy that bears witness to economic
shifts. Its price has dramatically jumped from 2150 Pacific francs
to the current 2900 (approximately 24 Euros), a change so recent
that the old price still faintly visible beneath the new price tags
tells a story of inflation.
</p><!-- l. 209 --><p class='indent'>   The smaller supermarket presents a different temporal
snapshot. Its price tags have yellowed with age, suggesting the
goods might be as brittle as the paper displaying their prices. After
careful consideration, I decide to purchase a yellow air mattress
that appears surprisingly robust, priced at a reasonable 950 Pacific
francs—roughly 8 Euros. A quick internet search reveals that
online retailers in Europe would offer the identical air mattress for
12 Euros, with the enticing bonus of free shipping on orders over
39 Euros. What a fascinating glimpse into the economic time
capsule of local retail!
</p><!-- l. 213 --><p class='indent'>   An amusing coincidence strikes me: the price of this air
mattress matches precisely the cost of a kilogram of locally grown
tomatoes. In this small moment of economic observation, the local
market reveals its own unique pricing logic—where an inflatable
recreational item and a staple food item can command the same
monetary value.
