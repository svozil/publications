<!-- l. 71 --><p class='noindent'>From Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, it is a five-hour
flight northeast to Fa’a’a, near Papeete on Tahiti. The night
flight with Air New Zealand is nearly empty, giving me the
luxury to stretch out and relax. Upon arrival at one o’clock
in the morning, we are greeted by intense heat—Tahiti’s
sole international airport lacks both air conditioning and a
skybridge.
</p><!-- l. 74 --><p class='indent'>   In the immigration area, a Polynesian trio greets us with South
Sea melodies, strumming ukuleles and swaying their hips
gracefully. Like figures in a mechanical music box, they
begin to play as soon as the first passengers approach. Their
movements, reminiscent of dancing ballerinas, freeze abruptly
when they run out of their flow of music—or the arrival of
passengers.
</p><!-- l. 76 --><p class='indent'>   Afterward, the small crowd of arrivals disperses into the
island’s dim constellation of airport lights, swallowed by the
surrounding Polynesian darkness. A sense of tropical despair,
emptiness, and scatteredness prevails. Most passengers linger in
the humid night air, awaiting their morning connections.
</p><!-- l. 79 --><p class='indent'>   Unable to secure a transfer to the ferry, I wait along with the
others and eventually board a very early bus bound for the quiet,
slumbering Papeete—a half-hour drive to its idle port. A young
couple joins me on this nocturnal journey.
</p><!-- l. 81 --><p class='indent'>   Carrying my suitcase through Papeete’s deserted streets,
from the bus station to the ferry terminal, feels surreal—a
journey reminiscent of a ride on the Grottenbahn in Vienna’s
                                                        
                                                        
Wurstelprater. Along the harbor, I pass a homeless man asleep,
stretched out on a bench, both exposing himself at critical parts,
as well as appearing exposed and vulnerable. The tropical
climate allows life to spill outdoors, leading to states of neglect
unimaginable in colder regions.
</p><!-- l. 86 --><p class='indent'>   In hindsight, I am grateful that it did not rain during this
interlude between the airport and the ferry terminal. We wait
another hour on the narrow sidewalk before the gates open,
bracing ourselves for a seven-hour crossing in rough weather
aboard a comfortable yet chilly ship.
