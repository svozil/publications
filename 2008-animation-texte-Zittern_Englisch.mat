"The peak regions of the Mount Blanc massif are icy and hostile; but only because they are in the temperature zones. In the Andes close to the Equator, altitudes around thirteen thousand feet are lush green and full of life. The majority of the volcanoes on the Atlantic islands are no longer considered to be active now. The craters have now developed into fertile valleys, and the hot sulphurous springs feed thermal baths, where rheumatism and other ailments are treated.",
"The floor of the Rhine Valley covers half of the country. It is the true agricultural area of the Principality, since the rest of the country is mountainous. In the Rhine Valley floor, a wide range of transitions between sand, peat, sandy clay, and clayey soil can be found. The soils of the Rhine Valley slope consist of detritus, moraine deposits, and some loess. The area is geologically extremely diverse.",
"Despite the mountainous location of the country, the climate can therefore be described as mild. It is heavily influenced by the south wind (Föhn). Wine and corn thrive primarily because of the moderating influence of this warm south wind. It lengthens the vegetation period in the spring and the fall. However, it sometimes also has the negative effect of drying out the soil and damaging the cultivation of fruit.",
"Anyone hiking through the Alps in the rain has certainly already encountered the Alpine salamander. It is the only amphibian in Liechtenstein that bears its young live. The grass frog, common toad, and the Alpine newt are also common, but they are dependent on bodies of water where they can spawn and where their larvae can develop into adult animals. The only poisonous snake in Liechtenstein, the adder, also only lives in the Alpine area.",
"Cooks have set a wide variety of culinary accents in Liechtenstein, which is why the country offers dishes and specialities from all around the world. But also local dishes like noodle pasta with cheese or Ribel (local grain variety) are big hits in local spots and gourmet restaurants alike. There are an astonishingly high number of establishments with Gault Millau points, Michelin stars and chef's hats. Hospitality is a high priority everywhere.",
"On the Sassweg trail, you will experience winter hiking from its most beautiful side, either alone or together with your children. In about an hour from Malbun, after passing ice flowers and snow-covered trees, you will reach the highest point on the 'Sassfürkle.' It is an undemanding hike via an Alp down tot the 'Schneeflucht' lift and back home. Snow hikes are also possible on other trails. Those who will have a more demanding hike can explore the alpine world on snowshoes.",
"His notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water. There are compositions for paintings, studies of details and drapery, studies of faces and emotions, of animals, babies, dissections, plant studies, rock formations, whirl pools, war machines, helicopters and architecture.",
"The main house, the wing and the churchyard wall form a small ornamental garden, at whose open end a pond with a jetty and a moored boat can be seen. Shifting clouds drift over the land. The moon illuminates a glimpse of magnificent mountains with jagged ridges and chasms. One line of peaks rises behind the other, higher and higher. The wind comes from the shore, and a bird can be heard singing.",
"First one comes upon a vast heath, which is wreathed in silence. Here and there a ruined wall still stands, or a wonderfully gnarled shrub; sometimes night birds whirr through the air, and one's own shadow glides alongside, long and dark in the idyllic silence. On the edge of the clearing stands an inn, in front of which some peasants sit, playing cards.",
"The park lies on a peninsula which is formed by two branches of a river. Beautiful trees grow along both sides and here and there afford delightful views of the meadow landscape through the foliage. The harbour in front is small, formed almost entirely by human hands and so shallow that it can take only small ships. Inside, a basin has been constructed, where ships can enter from the wharf.",
"The morning is glorious, though somewhat cloudy, but the dawn is still. The road passes a village where the hillside gardens are laid out in terraces and planted with lemon trees. The whole garden is composed of rows of square, white pillars, standing a certain distance apart and leading up the hillside in steps. Thick poles are laid across these pillars, to offer protection in winter to the trees planted between them.",

"The sun is ultimately the most important cause of winds and storms. Winds are currents of air trying to establish an equilibrium between areas of different atmospheric pressure, but they can vary tremendously in strength. Water literally gets everywhere. It falls from the clouds, takes detours via ground water currents, or shortcuts via rivers, streams and rivulets and finally returns to the sea, where it evaporates, rises up, and then falls back to earth again somewhere.",
"Varied flora grows on the 160 square kilometres of the territory. It is also the basis for rich fauna. There are three landscape types: the Rhine Valley, the Rhine Valley slopes, and the Alpine area. In the Rhine Valley, alluvial soil of the Rhine can be found, as well as marshy ground in the north. The Rhine has been dammed since the middle of the 19th century. The Rhine Valley slopes are preferred settlement areas. About 40% of the slopes are forested. The north-south ridges and valleys of the Alpine area take up about 1/3 of the area of the country.",
"The Föhn (warm south wind) provides a relatively favourable climate for warmth-loving plants from the Mediterranean region, which reach their northernmost extension here. The conjunction of three geological layers is of particular interest with respect to the distribution of species: the submerging Helvetikum in the Rhine Valley, the Upper East Alpine layer in the east, and the Pennine Arosa Zone in the south. An overview demonstrates the geological and paleontological richness of the region, resulting primarily from the subduction of the Eastern and Western Alps and from the pre-historic seashore.",
"Of the 1600 plant species, about 800 species are mountain flora, the rest are valley and slope flora. There are only few typical silicate plants, since the mountains are rich in limestone. Silicate can only be found in a few localized spots. In contrast to silicate flora, limestone flora offers more species and is more colourful and varied for the hiker. The botany of the region has been studied very extensively. Almost all of the 1600 species are documented in the Liechtenstein herbarium (dry plant collection).",
"The river side of the Rhine Dam is a true treasure chest of colourful and rare plants. On about 22 kilometres of the dam embankment, over 500 plant species can be found, many of which are mountain plants that were washed into the valley. Hikers enjoy the many orchids, such as the pyramid orchid (orchids pyramidalis). In addition, there are neophytes, plants imported by humans, mainly from the New World. Farmland weeds and ruderal vegetation, growing as pioneers on land reshaped by humans, find their last refuge here. This is also true for xerothermic, warmth-loving species, which congregate here in a very small area.",
"The dramatic vertical topography of the country, ranging from 430 to 2600 meters elevation, entails the existence of a wide variety of fauna in a limited area. In such a small Alpine country, Alpine fauna is naturally the focus of attention. The Alpine fauna is still complete, so to speak. In addition to the four large species of red deer, chamois, ibex, and golden eagle, other members of the Nordic-Alpine group of animals native to the Alpine area include the snow hare and the Alpine ptarmigan. Both animals know how to skilfully adapt to their environment by taking on a white protective colouring during the winter.",
"The Romans brought wine to the Liechtenstein region. At the end of the 19th century, wine was one of the main export products. The 'Föhn' wind casts a spell on Liechtenstein. Winegrowers in particular love the warm southerly wind, since the 'Föhn' and the mild climate ensure that vineyards grow and thrive exceptionally well throughout the country. The wines enjoy an excellent reputation internationally. Drop by the Hofkellerei of the Princely Domain Vaduz or visit another winery in the Upper Country or Lower Country and taste the fine wines.",
"Malbun, at a healthy 1600 meters (5250 feet) above sea level, is the ideal spot for a vacation in Liechtenstein, especially for families. But others can enjoy and dream at this healthy elevation as well. The air is clean, the sun is warm and the astures are lush green. Mountain streams murmur peacefully and softly. The mighty larch trees reflect against the naked rock face in the evening sun. Malbun is small and manageable. Adventure encounters with nature, fun and recreation.",
"Clapper bridges like this one can be seen spanning streams and ditches all over the English countryside. It is one of the earliest forms of bridge structure, and many of them have been in place for centuries. They can most often be seen in areas like Gloucester-shire, or the West Country where the abundance of stone made them cheap and easy to construct. They are less common in parts of the country characterized by the chalk or limestone landscapes, where the local materials were strong enough to build these simple slab bridges.",
"Many clapper bridges are constructed of one single slab of stone laid across from one bank of the stream to the other, but where the ditch is wider - and if the stream is shallow enough - piles of stones would be laid down across the water and smaller slabs used to connect them. These structures were strong, they needed to be sturdy enough to carry the weight of people and pack animals, and were virtually indestructible, which is why so many of them remain today. They make an addition to the countryside, often found in some of the most remote and beautiful parts of the country.",
"These paintings are famous for a variety of qualities which have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics. Among the qualities that make Leonardo's work unique are the innovative techniques that he used in laying on the paint, his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology, his interest in physiognomy and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture, his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition and his use of the subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper and the Virgin of the Rocks.",
"The hilltop in Tuscany is often surrounded by its own feudal village and its frame by cypress trees, almost certainly brought by the Etruscans from the eastern Mediterranean three thousand years ago. A purely decorative tree, the role of the cypress in the Tuscan landscape is to accentuate these noble villas and to make the solemn entrances to cemeteries on the edge of towns. That lone cypress or row of cypresses standing on the ridge line in southern Tuscany marks the last remnant of an approach to now bygone villa or farmhouse on that hillside.",
"The November sun pours its lustrous light over the agitated sea. Now and then a gust of wind comes and drives the spume right up to one's feet. Suddenly, the weather changed. A persistent north-westerly wind drives a mass of clouds before it, and the sea froths mightily. Nevertheless there is no rain, and it is not cold. This excursion, with the cloudy sky and raging surf, is almost even more beautiful than before, when the sun had been shining and the sea had been calm.",
"Along the western shore, where the mountains are no longer steep and the landscape falls more gently to the lake, lies a row of small villages and towns, each at a distance of one kilometre from the next. No words can express the loveliness of this densely populated region. The portico of a theatre building is embellished by six tall Ionic columns. Over the door, which is supported by two Corinthian columns, the life-size bust of a woman appears all the more diminutive.",
"One arrives on a hill and finds oneself in a high forest of fir trees, the trunks of which are three or four paces apart. The ground is solid and carpeted with moss, and the branches high above have grown together to form a dark green roof. Alleyways of tall birches provide a solemn welcome. Large, curious flowers flutter betwixt golden birds, dreamily waving their golden and scarlet bell-like flowers back and forth in the gentle breeze.",
"In the evening one reaches the next town. Countless fountains gurgle, with gilded balls dancing on the water. Between the trees, a magnificent palace with tall, slender columns can be seen shimmering in the distance. There is no sign of human life. Only now and then a nightingale awakes and sings. One gazes in awe at the trees, the fountains and flowers, as if everything had been submerged for an eternity and the years were flowing over one in gentle, clear waves.",

"The Black Sea is an inland sea bounded by south-eastern Europe, the Caucasus and the Anatolian Peninsula (Turkey) and is ultimately connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and various straits. The Bosporus strait connects it to the Sea of Marmara, and the strait of the Dardanelles connects it to the Aegean Sea region of the Mediterranean. These waters separate Eastern Europe and western Asia. The Black Sea also connects to the Sea of Azov by the Strait of Kerch.",
"In very general terms, the climate is determined by geographic latitude, the vertical topography, and the position of the country relative to the sea. Because of the small size of the country, the geographic latitude differential is unimportant. The vertical segmentation of the country into the Rhine Valley and the mountainous part rising from the valley is, however, significant. In the winter, temperatures seldom drop below minus 15 degrees Celsius, while the average temperatures in the summer oscillate between 20 and 28 degrees.",
"The blooming wild flower meadows are splendid in June and July. Wild flower meadows (rough pastures) are not as productive as sweet meadows, but they are prettier and more diverse. The soil is low in humus, often dries up during the low-precipitation months of summer, and usually contains limestone. In a very small area, up to a hundred different plant species grow, including rare and protected species. In contrast, only 20 to 30 different species grow in sweet meadows. 24 different orchid species thrive in wildflower meadows! Wild flower meadows are anthropogenic pasture lands, i.e., they were created by humans.",
"A long time ago, artificial forest clearings attracted species in search of light. The invention of the scythe in the Middle Ages made it possible to develop large areas for extensive agricultural use. The farmer simultaneously becomes a landscape gardener. Since the Second World War, ever more intensive use of the previously contiguous wildflower meadows began. Today, about 90% of the previous wildflower meadows have made way to intensive agriculture. The remainder is subsidized by the State, in order to preserve this unique type of landscape.",
"The Alpine area is rich in insects. The Alpine grass heath is the main habitat of the Liechtenstein butterfly, both in terms of extension as well as number of species. Among grasshoppers and crickets, the Siberian grasshopper can only be found in a few locations, the chirring cricket even only in the area between Steg and Malbun at 1500 meters elevation. Alpine fauna includes the widespread marmot, the northern bat, and among birds the black grouse, the three-toed woodpecker, the boreal owl, the Eurasian pygmy owl, the jackdaw, the wall creeper, the snow finch, the rock pipet, the Alpine accentor, and the citril finch.",
"Mountain biking is in, and numerous routes in the impressive valley and mountain world oft he Liechtenstein and Werdenberg region guarantee an appreciation of nature and fitness as well. There are relatively easy, more challenging and also sweat-inducing tours, as well marked. The various stages are diverse. The physical condition and biking ability determine the route. The ride from Schaan to Gafadura Alp is very popular. Taking a break at the Alp with its fantastic view is the reward for the efforts.",
"The Princely Collections embrace major European works of art spanning five centuries and are today among the world's most important private art collections. They date back to the beginning of the 17th century. Like many other collections of this period, they are rooted in the baroque ideal of engaged princely patronage of the arts. For generations, the House of Liechtenstein has remained true to this ideal and systematically extended its collections. An active purchasing policy results in interesting new acquisitions.",
"The diminutive size of the cathedral does not detract from its splendour. It is actually older than the college, and was once part of an ancient settlement. Today, most of the construction dates from medieval times, and is a splendid example of Norman architecture. Other settlements have been added to the college buildings since this time, most notably the great bell tower, known affectionately as Tom Tower, which was part of plans drawn up for the college by the renowned architect.",
"Leonard's early life has been the subject of historical conjecture. Vasari, the 16th century biographer of Renaissance painters tells of how a local peasant requested that Ser Piero ask his talented son to paint a picture on a round plaque. Leonardo responded with a painting of snakes spitting fire which was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine art dealer, who sold it to the Duke of Milan. Meanwhile, having made a profit, Ser Piero bought a plaque decorated with a heart pierced by an arrow, which he gave to the peasant.",
"On first impressions, the countryside surrounding the town of Ironbridge reveals little of its great past, but hidden in the hillsides are relics of a great industrial age. The Iron Bridge is the most famous, and most magnificent, remnant of the area's period of prosperity. Before this was built, the only method of crossing the River Severn here was by boat or via a medieval bridge which lay a few miles away. The bridge, a structure that combined beauty with strength through its arched sides and iron railings, was opened in 1781. For the first time, a working model illustrated the newly discovered properties of cast iron.",
"From this vantage point, it is possible to look out across the Atlantic. On a clear day, the Scilly Isles are visible, and over a mile out to sea stands the Longships lighthouse. By far the most dramatic features to be seen from here, however, are the fantastic outcrops along the Cliffside. They have all been christened with romantic names- the Irish lady and Armed Knight among them - to describe the strange shapes that have been formed from the granite by centuries of erosion. The area is also known for its many ancient monuments.",
"First one passes some modest houses, then through a magnificent gateway into the famous city. The sun's rays glisten between the palaces. The fountains babble on the lively squares, and the gardens which border the streets fill the air with invigorating fragrance. The morning is fresh and imbued with the dewy cool of summer. It is the beginning of a glorious day. The mild air, wafted along by a great river, is something quite unique.",
"The forest had been rent asunder, the lake lies at one's feet, and all the mountains which had been visible from the flat land now rise up around the water. So clear and close that they seem within one's reach. The gorges and crevices are swathed in an ethereal blue, and the trees stand on them like miniature logs. The mountains descend into the forest. The shallow lake seems to reflect the mountains which it borders. The nose discerns a subtle fragrance, which comes from the green of the fir needles.",
"The path is still partly wet and yet firm; below, on the right, the river can be seen. The view stretches along its glistening length. On the far side, the steep riverbank rises up in the dark forest. In the distance many ridges of the mountains can be seen, looming up like solitary pyramids in infinite silence. Light and shade of exactly the same hue as the mountains, a sea of brilliant white and deep blue, but cast in a thousand forms, each one billowing up above the next.",
"The morning awakes. The spring seed is freshly sown, and the day before the harrow had been taken over it. Now flocks of crows are hopping around in the loose earth, picking up the grains, clamouring together, vying for a space and cawing over the threatened seed, audible from far away. Following the path which runs the length of the fields, one turns the corner of the fence and comes down onto the beach, where a net shed stands.",
"The shed lies, shut up, under a small bridge, and on the shore the boats are brought up and waiting to be released. On a piece of ground next to a haphazardly enclosed garden stands a small villa. It does not look remotely spacious or magnificent. It is a one-storey villa in a modest Empire style and appears to have been renovated not too long ago. All the green window blinds are lowered, and there is no indication that the villa could be inhabited."
