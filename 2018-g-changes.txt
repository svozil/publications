Dear Editors,

I kindly thank the Referee for carefully reading the manuscript.

I have followed all the recommendations of the Referee.

In particular, here is a list of changes:

*) On page 2, at the beginning of point B, the following corrections have been made:

from "...and others have uses..." to "...and others have used...".

*) On page 3, I have added the absolute (modulus) square of the scalar product for the definition of Gleason-Lovasz-Born type probabilities.

*) On page 3, when describing what happens when orange and blue glasses are used,
the following corrections have been made twice:
"(i), ...., (ii), ... and (ii) ...." to "(i), ...., (ii), ... and (iii) ....".

Please do not hesitate to write to me if further changes are necessary.

Thank you very much for all your efforts!

With kind regards,
Karl Svozil
