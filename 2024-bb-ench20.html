<!-- l. 479 --><p class='noindent'>The travelogue Besides Paul Gauguin’s “Noa Noa” (Fragrant
Scent), “The Happy Isles of Oceania: Paddling the Pacific” by
Paul Theroux is probably still standard South Seas literature. This
travel diary through the South Seas was recommended to me by
my esteemed friend Herbert Gottweis, who was torn from this
world far too soon by a malignant brain tumor into the unknown,
“from which no man ever returned”—except perhaps Jesus,
the anointed “Christ”, at least if one is to believe today’s
theologians. Their guild once branded and persecuted those of
different faiths as “heretics”: After the Council of Nicaea,
all who doubted the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth and his
resurrection were persecuted, banished, and if necessary,
burned.
</p><!-- l. 481 --><p class='indent'>   The abundance of Theroux’s impressions, which he
experienced while quasi paddling through the Pacific, is
impressive. The chapter “New Zealand: Sloshing through the
South Island” alone lacks no clarity and coincides with much
of what this author has experienced on the North Island of
Aotearoa.
</p><!-- l. 483 --><p class='indent'>   However, Theroux’s journey is now also over thirty years ago
and allows for additions and supplements. This little book is such
a supplement. May it delight and inspire the readership! For man
is very often much freer than he believes himself to be, and
summer in winter is just like the light in the heavy, the bright in
the dark, and the dark in the radiant.
