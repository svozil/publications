\@doendnote{endnote66}{ In classical physics, there is no conceptual or principal reason to assume counterfactuals; sometimes they are just considered for convenience (saving the experimenter from measuring redundant observables). The empirical sciences implement classical omniscience by assuming that in principle all observables of classical physics are (co-)measurable without any restrictions, and regardless of whether they are actually measured or not. No distinction is made between an observable obtained by an ``actual'' and a ``potential'' measurement. (In contrast, compare Schr\"odinger's own interpretation of the wave function (in \protect \S  7 of Ref.\protect \nobreakspace  {}\cite {schrodinger}) as a ``catalogue of expectations.'') Precision and (co-)measurability are limited only by the technical capacities of the experimenter. The principle of empirical classical omniscience has given rise to the realistic believe that all observables ``exist,'' regardless of their observation; i.e., regardless and independent of any particular measurement. Physical (co-)existence is thereby related to the realistic assumption \cite {stace} (sometimes referred to as the ``ontic'' \cite {atman:05} viewpoint) that such physical entities exist even without being experienced by any finite mind. The formal expressions of necessary conditions related to classical omniscience are the following two properties. (i) The algebra of observable propositions is Boolean \cite {Boole}. In particular, the classical logical operations satisfy the distributive law. Historically, the discovery of the uncertainty principle and quantum complementarity marked a first departure from classical omniscience. A formal expression of complementarity is the nondistributive algebra of quantum observables. Alas, nondistributivity of the empirical logical structure is no sufficient condition for the impossibility of omniscience. For example, both generalized urn models \cite {wright:pent,wright} as well as equivalent \cite {svozil-2001-eua} finite automata \cite {e-f-moore,schaller-96,dvur-pul-svo,cal-sv-yu} exhibit complementarity, yet they possess two-valued states interpretable as omniscience; i.e., as global truth assignments with a consistent value ``0'' ({\protect \em  false}) or ``1'' ({\protect \em  true}) for every observable. (ii) the ``abundance'' of two-valued states interpretable as omniscience of the system: Thereby, any such ``dispersionless'' two-valued state --- associated with a ``truth table'' --- can be defined on all observables, regardless of whether they have been actually observed or not. }
\@doendnote{endnote67}{ In an informal paper \cite {specker-60} announcing KS, Specker referred to scholastic philosophy dealing with ``infuturabilities.'' Indeed, the use of counterfactuals is not new; neither is the idea of a (divine) {\protect \em  omniscience} ``knowing'' all the factuals and counterfactuals in the naive sense that ``if a proposition is true, then an omniscient agent (such as God) knows that it is true.'' Already Thomas Aquinas considered questions such as whether God has knowledge of non-existing things (Ref.\protect \nobreakspace  {}\cite {Aquinas}, Part 1, Question 14, Article 9) or things that are not yet (Ref.\protect \nobreakspace  {}\cite {Aquinas}, Part 1, Question 14, Article 13). }
