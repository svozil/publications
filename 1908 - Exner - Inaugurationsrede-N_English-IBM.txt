High-class assembly! early paragraph 01

Due to the trust of my colleagues from all the faculty to this honorable place, I had to consider, above all, whether I would also be able to justify this trust; the diversity of our organism is, of course, a tremenlious one. and the great ones are accordingly the needs as well as the lifestation of the same in every direction. If, however, all areas of human knowledge and research are represented here, and who wants to do justice to this diversity, the relationship between the individual parts, their interrelations and differences, will be determined in accordance with the following: To be able to repel. The goal, of course, that all disciplines at our alma mater are striving for is the same: the exploration of truth, that objective truth that exists uninfluenced by human resources and thought; but the ways in which the tools are to be found The collection of this treasure is of such a different nature that there is little or no repute between many members of our large family, for example, at least.

End paragraph 01

Early paragraph 02

It has long been possible to divide the whole range of disciplines into two large groups, humanistic and natural sciences, following a natural principle and the sphere of influence of the human being with its rich content from the As a humanities, on the one hand, as an exact sciences, on the other hand, the representations of these two groups are to be called. Without wanting to give the right of these typical names somehow to the right, their existence alone already proves that a sharp separation of the two areas was necessary for the need, yes, of course, it has always been the same as in principle different.

End paragraph 02

Early paragraph 03

I confess that I cannot agree with this view; of course, there is a difference, it is obvious at first glance: natural science does not apply to laws, human studies, on the other hand, where the word "law" does not exist in the in the sense of the word as a law, but rather in the sense of a mathematically formulated, always and without exception, quantitative relationship to be taken. The astronomer can predict the entrance of a solar eclipse to a century, the physicist will indicate the passage of a light beam, the chemist indicates the occurrence of a reaction with certainty, they all have in some sense the property of a Prophets. Alone can the historian, and the whole past clearly in front of his eye, predicting only an event of the next few years with certainty? Certainly not; here the "law" lacks its strict validity and so the designation of natural science as an "exact" science may also have some justification.

End paragraph 03

Early paragraph 04

It is often the case that in the course of the development of its disciplines it has not brought about exact laws in the course of the development of its disciplines, and equally often the incline results of natural science, which only after the knowledge of the laws, have been made It was possible to pay the researchers a special honour. I mean, that one did not proceed quite fairly on both sides, with praise and with tadel. Of course, the difference is that this is not to be denied, but whether he is in the methods of the different disciplines, whether he is as shroff as he seems, whether he is really a principled one who makes the world in two parts Splits, that's dubious. And here we find ourselves facing a problem of extraordinary scope, because it concerns the whole field of human knowledge: because the events that make up the course of world history are the thousand times the changes in a language for their everyday development, are the advantages of the daily life that we are able to find in order to establish national-economic, legal or sociological concepts, are not all the things of nature?

End paragraph 04

Early paragraph 05

So why are there no laws here? Thus, we are faced with the major question: Is there really two kinds of nature, one in which everything happens according to strict, never-failing laws, and a second one does not know such laws, where the events will follow each other willfully? It will be very difficult for any researcher to believe in such a gap of nature, the more necessary, however, it becomes clear to us that and why this disciple is not a principled, in fact only a gradual one. So I understand from the whole complex of questions that can be knocked out, just the one out: why does science know strict laws, but doesn't the humanities know? and I want to try to answer the same thing as far as I can.

End paragraph 05

Early paragraph 06

All the laws of nature, the word always in its strict meaning, are physical laws; can the present be played in the sky space as an object of astronomical observation or in the melting pot of the chemist or under the microscopes of the Botanists and physiologists, if they run lawfully, so follow physical laws. The task of the physicist is to get rid of these laws of all the accompanying symptoms; it is the same whether a grain of sand attracts the other or the sun is the planet, its goal is the general law, and so he has All the nature with such things; I say deliberately the whole nature, in contrast to the dead matter, because all physical laws apply without exception to the living as well as for the liveess.

End paragraph 06

Early paragraph 07

A very naïve idea of these laws of nature has relegated these laws as properties into the coffers themselves, it has been regarded as a property of the magnet to attract the iron, or the celestial body, to gravitate against each other, as a property of light, one has been called to be reflective of its ability to be reflected or to be broken, and thus put into the nature itself the knowledge of the laws. However, these laws do not exist in nature, which only formulates the human being, he uses it as a linguistic and computational means of aid, and thus only wants to say that the pretexts in nature proceed as if the matter, a matter of matter, is to be equal in nature. obey these laws. Newton first established the law of general gravity and the concept of attraction, but this latter had no realit�t for him, it should only be excluded in a concise manner that the masses under their mutual Influence really a movement beating as if such a force and nothing more exist.

End paragraph 07

Early paragraph 08

The laws of nature, however, also apply to seemingly very different territories 1 for non-independent existences; the unity of nature subsumes them under more general laws, in this sense higher laws, than their special role, according to the respective conditions, they appear. The course of events in nature is seemingly ruthless and chaotic: in the course of time, countries and seas have changed their roles, rain and sunshine draw on us, plants, animals and humans in an unregulated sequence, and with everything you live out, and who only thinks one day of his life, with all the minor changes that affect him, what kind of events of events are there together? You need to despair here to find a red thread, which serves us as a guide through this tangle. But the chaotic of the apparition disappears all the time, we notice that the events do not follow each other as willfully as it seems, we realize that not every event is possible and the apparitions are about as well as just like different hats could run. Above all, we find that no event in nature becomes self-dependent, everything is striving for a certain goal; in the short time of a human life, we hardly notice the change, which has, in this way, gone with nature in the best way, but in every single case, it makes us clear to the eyes. We see the stone falling, the water from the mountains rzen, but no eye has yet to climb a stone even into the height, or the ' water to see the mountain. The scent of a perfumed smelling patch is likely to spread in a larger space soon, but in vain we will wait for it to pull itself back into the river again. The glut of the heated oven rages through a room; but has it ever been observed that in the summer season the July heat of a room is concentrated by itself in the oven and there a fire lit up? And as in these individual cases, in general all events in nature seek to achieve a particular goal; dissipation of energy the physicist calls this process, which is organic and inorganic, dead and living matter and all the activity of man in the same way.

End paragraph 08

Early paragraph 09

Why, however, do we ask, are the ancestor in nature not ruthless? About because laws rule? The laws are abstracted from the rules and only prove that they are, but not why they run regularly. At this turning point of human knowledge, I have to remember a man whose skill I cannot, at this point, enrich enough to be honorable, L. Boltzmann. It was he who first gave this direction of general action a certain and clear interpretation; he has, to put it short, showed that the world in its development is indispensable from minder more likely in more likely and thus also Ever more stable surgings are going on. Boltzmann was the most zealous investor and defender of the atomistic worldview, an idea that has nowhere to contradict with the experience, but probably has been able to change our knowledge in all areas, an idea According to this, all matter consists of enormously numerous and extremely small particle particles, the molecules, which are in the best of quite irregular movement, which we perceives as arms, are understood. With very simply constituted cations, such as the gases, we know the number and size of these molecules and their velocities with gendered accuracy and therefore Boltzmann has just given the gases as the starting point of his observations. The question which he asked himself and which he discussed with all the steps in every direction, to finally decide it completely affirmatively; was the: The state of a gas, as it is well known to us experimentally by the laws, he is maybe nothing but the result of a feat, as the result of the additional individual movements of the countless molecules in the same? As I said, the question is to be answered in the affirit, and with that we have the key to everything more in our hands.

End paragraph 09

Early paragraph 10

It is a widespread error to believe that zuchy events also have an undetermined result, that is to say undetermined result; if so the finance minister h�tte the lotto has been cancelled already, but since the experience teaches that the for the events of the drawings, however, give a very specific result. But one condition must be fulfilled, should such a condition be expected: the additional events must be followed in large numbers. If we play the well-known game head or writing with a M�nze, then the result for each individual litter is quite too high and it is probably possible for the beginning of the game that the head or writing is in the number of times. However, when the events, that is to say here the wrists, are created, the result is striving for a very specific value, of equality, and comes to this with time always, in order to reach it precisely after infinitely many ovens. It should be noted that the time itself does not matter, but only the number of individual events, that it is quite equal, whether the course quickly or slowly follows one another, when it is only genically often happens, just as the result of a Lottoeducation does not depend on whether all numbers are drawn in the same hour or approximately at intervals of days and years. What in these examples the walls or drawing, in the case of all matter are the relative molecular movements in the interior of the body, they are the individual events from which are available for us visible state of a body according to the laws of the probability calculus. And since these movements are extremely large in number, in the smallest of our observation tractable kittens already millionth-and trillions in the second repeat, so we can expect and we expect the respective ones most likely to be found. In a cubic centimeter of the air that surrounds us, we have such an enormous number of molecules that you have, for example, B. the number of people who have ever bevented the earth disappears.

End paragraph 10

Early paragraph 11

All of these molecules move through each other at large velocities, which are equal in averages to those of rifle bullets. However, the path that the individual molecule has to do, it will be a more complete one, it will depend on how often and in which directions it is currently working together with other molecules, and at each such collision its own direction will be and speed. However, this chaos of events leads, as Boltzmann's account has shown, to the necessity of precisely those aspects and characteristics that we observe in gases. A certain distribution of the speeds among the molecules will turn out to be the most likely; very small and very large speeds will be correspondingly unlikely and therefore rare, those of medium size. are most likely to occur and the condition of the body is much more important. However, since the individual events follow one another so rapidly that even the smallest observation time must be regarded as practically infinitely long, it cannot be surprised if we already in every observation the gas in of his most likely condition. But that does not mean anything else, as we observe the laws of law which are produced by chance, but that these laws differ in the various fields of physics, which is the result of this, that the conditions are by no means the same in all cases under which these movements are going on. However, since all matter is molecularly constituted, the basic condition for the establishment of a certain most probable condition, i.e. the approximate number of individual events, will also be given and thus also the basic condition for the establishment of a certain most probable condition. the possibility of a law.

End paragraph 11

Early paragraph 12

If we are able to slow down the molecular movement so outrageously that we could follow the individual molecular preferences, we would not perceive anything as a mess of random events in which we are searching in vain for a law. We have to wait; over the years we have to wait, before under this knowledge of the K�rper its most probable condition is reached, that condition that normally occurs in vanishing small fractions of a second, and so it is clear and must be particularly stressed that where the infused Events too slow to follow one another, even from a law cannot be the speech.

End paragraph 12

Early paragraph 13

I still need to show a simple example of how natural laws are created. If we play with two boards, the position of the individual cube is a complete one for each litter, that is, the number of eyes which it shows; but are therefore also all the possible sums, from two to twelve, with the same Probability to expect? Certainly not. Because the number two can only be thrown in a single way and likewise the number zw�lf; can, for example, B. the number four already appears in three ways by the combination of two-two, one-three and three-one, and since each position of the individual cube is equally likely, the sum four is also three times as many times as possible in the averages. expect to be the sum of two or twelve. Of all the possible combinations, however, is the number seven, which is the largest probability for itself, and the numbers are always the numbers that deviate from the seven upwards or downwards by the same amount, So eight and six, nine and for usf., are equally likely, so that with a large number of repetitions of the attempt the average number of the seven is increasingly n�hert, although in each individual case the location of each cube a it is. If we continue the game infinitely long, we can expect to have thrown the number seven in the averages with absolute certainty. Here, in practice, we do not yet speak of a law, or of a law or probability, because we still have to do with the individual events, the ovens, but these are followed by such rapid succession, We say many millions of times in a second that we did not follow the individual moments of the process, but only the average result of the whole of us before, so we would find that each time the number seven to the prelude , and so we could and would like to see it as a law in the strict sense of Word that you throw the number seven with two boards.

End paragraph 13

Early paragraph 14

Thus, natural laws are created; a system which consists of events which are completely open to each other and which, according to the conditions under which it stands, are to aspire to a certain, most probable, and therefore legal, state. But the example teaches us even more; it shows us that only after the entry of infinitely many individual events the result is to be expected with absolute certainty, but with a finite number of the same but always only with a certain degree of the Probability, which, however, is an ever-increasing we the more the events are created. Since no natural phenomenon we can observe, really consists of infinitely many parts, so there is also no absolute natural law, all our laws are only probability laws; but, of course, the probability of the of our prediction, which may well be such an enormous amount that it can be the same for human beings of certainty.


End paragraph 14

Early paragraph 15

Exact laws of nature thus in the mathematical sense of the word do not exist; and if it is such, so we could not bear witness to their exactness, because this would only be possible through the experiment, but all experiments are necessary with errors and thus we never get into a v�lent agreement between law and experiment.

End paragraph 15

Early paragraph 16

From the more recent examples with the boards, however, there is still something that is of importance for the further considerations; if we as a simple result with a large probability (at infinitely many furnaces with certainty) the number seven expect, this is an average value that refers to all previous steps. The individual litter, however, is too good and so we can not say that we throw in the next few things about the Seven, we can only expect, at the next set of very many ovens on average again the result seven are to be obtained. Thus, the law is only an average law and applies to the individual case, or to the few, it loses its importance in a vetted manner.

End paragraph 16

Early paragraph 17

In which case the individual events must be created, so that we can expect a certain average result, that is quite different from the degree of probability from which we demand. The number of numbers set in the lottery in one year, i.e. the number of individual games, already guarantees such a high probability of winning that one can adjust it with calming into the budget. The business of insurance companies is based on the statistics collected, that is, always on a limited number of cases, but these are generally experienced in the general.

End paragraph 17

Early paragraph 18

However, if the individual events after thousands of people may even go after millions in a year, then this is still a very small number of those molecular projections from which the physicist derives his laws, because Since already in the smallest objects in every second trillions of zuluchnge play off. In a cubic centimeter of air here, in every second, there are so many random together among the molecules, that they can only be excluded by a number with 28 digits; it is therefore easy to measure that the probability of the Our laws are of a very different order than that of the winner of the lottery, and that this probability, humanly speaking, equals the certainty.

End paragraph 18

Early paragraph 19

But in the small, the time like the space, the physical laws are not likely to apply; the stone is ready for earth and we know exactly the law according to which it moves. Whether this law also applies to any small fraction of the movement, for billionths or trillionths of a second, that is more than doubtful. Probably here, too, the movement in the smallest of times is a zuppllige, sometimes faster sometimes slower than our law it demands, maybe a jerky, but we can not notice anything, we only observe the average the movement and this one is lawfully. We may well indicate the movement of the water in a channel, but the path that the individual water particles describes is a v�llig one and discovers the laws of the river.

End paragraph 19

Early paragraph 20

Thus, we need all so-called exact laws only as average laws that do not apply with absolute certainty, but with the greater probability of the more individual cases they arise. All the laws of physics go back to the molecular bias of nature and from them the result follows the laws of probability calculation, in that the world in its parts and as a whole is made of less likely To be more likely to be overseen. Why this transition takes place, we have already seen in the example with the two boards: the number seven to throw is therefore most likely because there are most possibilities available, all possibilities among themselves but, to the random, equal probable. After all, an event occurs where chance prevails, the more likely it is, the more likely it is. This sentence, known as the law of the great number 1 is not proven, is also non-proof, but it is taken from the thousand-good experience of the people and forms the foundation of all probability calculus. In fact, it is the only law that dominates all events in nature, it says that always those surges enter m�ssen1 for their existence most possibilities offer themselves.

End paragraph 20

Early paragraph 21

As to the degree of probability of a condition, I would like to illustrate this in all cases in the following examples. We take a handful of wheat men and throw them on the ground; no one will expect that the K�rner will form a strikingly regular figure, a star or circle, that letters and words of well-known meaning , however, some quite irregular distribution will be the result. Now, however, this distribution, as it happens, is nothing more likely than any of the more regular, we can only look at the fact that the irregular arrangements have a very large number, the regular, that is, the striking, but just a vanishingly small. However, we simply set the irregularity to the contrary and since for the latter the number of possibilities is a much larger one, the irregularity will be the most likely to be expected in the averages, that is, the most likely Be the result. And so any system ordered by itself will move from itself to the state of disorder, if it is subject to a large number of random events. If we assign the wheat men from the beginning to a regular figure and then put them out completely to the ground, then the regularity would be lost very soon. So the most common disorder is the most likely state of affairs; that is, every housewife, the wit of every librarian. If the books of a library were initially ordered and if one had to leave the use of the same v�llig the chance, then the regular arrangement of the same would disappear soon, simply because it is very unlikely that any book by chance will be put back to its place, since there is only one right, but very many wrong pl�s. Thus, it is also a quite improbable, because regular state, if, for example, B. in a body all the molecules have the same speed, and we can be able to produce the same, the body w�rde, letting itself leave, not to remain in this improbable state, but in the to be disorderly unorderly. So no one of us will experience that in a certain moment all the people of Vienna who are on the road, go exactly the same fast, if the possibility must also be admitted, because this singular case of order a In the end of paragraph 21, there is a large number of opposing possibilities.

Early paragraph 22

That is why we need every orderly state, as paradoxical as it sounds, as a resounding view, as a state of affairs that we can only be able to sustain through the best possible interventions against nature and against the law of the Zufalles. All legal laws, written and unwritten, which keep the course of society in order, are nothing other than such interventions; it seems to us to have an effect, and yet it plays only a minor role in the Households of nature, regulates only a vanishing small fraction of general events. But, of course, what we see in the near, which surrounds us directly, that seems to us to be great and meaningful, the distance is blurred in the space as in time and what it holds in the interest of losing interest. But that's why we don't want to forget that man and his doing just means a tiny episode in world history.

End paragraph 22

Early paragraph 23

Herbert Spencer says: "Evolution is a change of inequality to balance, of indeterminacy to determination, of disorder to order." However, that is exactly the opposite of the result to which we have come. Now, it's not exactly the first time that philosophers and naturalist researchers answer a question in different senses, but perhaps more often than you think the difference, like here, is more of an apparent than a real one. If one understands a state of law to understand the laws, as Herbert Spencer probably means, then we vote completely, only we have seen that such zustÃ ¤ ing constantly, d. h. of observation, and of itself only by the fact that the additional individual events which they bring about are unordered, because only in this way will a certain state of seriousness arise, precisely that which we then the The Law of Apparial.

End paragraph 23

Early paragraph 24

We cannot oversee a circumstance of importance here; it is intended as a consequence of incidental events to an innate goal, d. h. to a certain average state, the more reasonable conditions did not occur until such time as much events had occurred, in order to provide a usable average. Because, depending on these more conditions, the most likely state is another and so it would never come to an end, if these conditions are so fast to change as the events follow each other. The number seven is the average of the games with two W�rfeln; for three, four or more W�rfel are applicable other numbers and so we could not expect a certain value, if during the wary the number of the W�rfel, which is here the �u�er condition to be able to be changed as desired.

End paragraph 24

Early paragraph 25

So we have to recognize a number of changes that lead to the legality of an apparition or, in the extreme case, to an exact law: a large number of individual events must be played out, and in such a rapid succession that we only their average value can be observed, and during this time the more conditions will remain unhindered. All the laws of physics arise in this way, even the laws of optics do not have a validity that the vibrations of the light do not be so fast that we only have the average effect of trillions of the same in mind. And if we have to fill the voices of an orchestra in order to improve the sound, and thereby multiply the sound of the sound, then this is again only the game of the Zufalles, the effect of which can therefore be expected with such great security, because The vibrations of the sound are also very fast.

End paragraph 25

Early paragraph 26

But one important fact will be taken from all of this: no natural law can be subject to absolute rigour. It is always only an even though high degree of probability, with which we can expect the occurrence of a certain event; exceptions can and must even occur in the course of the infinite time. However, such individual phenomena, which contradict the laws of nature, are what we call miracles, and so we come to claim to be able to assert their ability. But, of course, do we expect to ever experience such a thing? If the hand full of wheat men, which we scatter on the ground, alludes to a previously determined words, then we must address this as a miracle; if it is no doubt, it is no doubt, but no one will experience it, for this is what we are seeing. Singular case of order is such a massive number of equally probable disorderly states as a result of the large number of wheat men and their possible orders that we try to repeat the attempt over all the Ma�s often before once that would have been. Result can be expected. However, the number of molecules in the bodies is still of a completely different order than that of wheat seeds in our examples, so an exception to a physical law becomes even more improbable and the possibility of its Entrance is entirely up to all human imagination. Do we not have a right to speak of the accuracy of the laws of nature? Mathematically, we do not have it, but in the human sense of the word, the laws have absolute validity in that we can rightly expect no human being to ever experience an exception.

End paragraph 26

Early paragraph 27

So we see that the laws of nature do not apply with absolute certainty, but only as long and in so far as the additional individual events are the effect they represent, are very numerous. If the number of these decreases, the probability degree for the validity of the law decreases at the same time, and we come, if not the averages, but the individual events themselves, form the object of our observation, as in the area of bad zufalles, where every lawfulness has disappeared.

End paragraph 27

Early paragraph 28

And with that, we have reached the point where we can easily recognize why in the field of human studies, in contrast to natural science, laws rarely laws but never occur.

End paragraph 28

Early paragraph 29

All the objects of humanistic research are also present in nature; they may be the passage of world history, national-economic problems or the emergence and development of the languages, it is always a case of individual events that are the it does not separate itself from nature, but as a piece of it. Emperors and Kings are subject to the laws of nature as well as any stone and no hair width they can be the same; why do we ask, does the course of world history do not follow the same strict laws as the running of the Gestirne? It is true that the individual events, the actions of the people and the changes that they bring about, in the majority and in the whole, are of course only for a single kind of thing. It is the human being according to free will, that is true, but what he wants, what he wants in every moment of his life, that is on a millennials chain of lofles. And so here too the law of the Zufalles will be brought into effect, even the human race has to go over the course of time from less likely to more probable surges. If we compare the state of a culture volke with that wild voyage or even of the pr�historic man, as far as we know, we find a striking balance on this side in opposites to a body of Inequality in the physical, intellectual and social relationship on the one that increases, the more the culture becomes. But, as we know, the balance is a very improbable state, which itself always goes into the inequality, the disorder, in which, with regard to each individual moment, a mean value is the most likely, of which, according to the At the top or bottom, but the rarer, the more they get away from the cut. That is why the large number of average people in each volke, to which only a few geniuses, but also only a few very deep individuals, stand up; therefore, also in a material relationship the class of the middle class as opposed to the singles Appearances of the very rich and the very possessiles. The completely equal distribution of the spiritual as well as the material quality is an improbably improbable state, but we are all the more so, the more we look in the culture and in the time after r�ckw�rts. Thus, in general, the development of history may be analogous to that of another natural phenomenon, but why does it not show us any laws? We only expect laws there where we have the result of a very large number of events. Now, the events of world history are numerous, but there are numerous laws that result in the physical In terms of accuracy, this can only result in a comparison. If the physicist also only operates with a mass of the size of a pin head and only for one second, then a very large number of random events, the molecular movements, have already played out in his hand during this time. How long did the historian wait to have the same number available? It is difficult to protect this, because the individual event in the development of the story cannot be determined; we can perhaps take the individual human life for it or the individual actions of the people, but we ourselves do the Certainly driven assumption that of one hundred million people each in every second intervenes effectively once in the course of history, so it would still continue to last three thousand million years until the historian of the cases of Events to be available as the physicist in the more recent case in the course of a Second. Can one still expect laws? But even if our lifespan extends over such periods, and we could see everything that happened, with a glance, we would still not discover a law, because such a set, as we know, presupposes that the The development of a system is always carried out under the same conditions; if this is the process of the process, it aspires to another end, and the conditions of historical development in such time periods more than once to be able to change, is self-esteeming.

End paragraph 29

Early paragraph 30

Also, the laws of nature are always only average laws; therefore, to the historian himself the impossible to overlook the course of events in millions of years, he could not say, as in the next century, the The result is that it is the average result of the following millions of years. However, it will be said that, in the course of history, not only the visible events are involved, but the whole body of the imponderabilia that cannot be grasped; but the physicist finds himself in the same position. Under Imponderabilia, we understand events whose physical correlat remains unknown to us and only too often the physicist is able to find himself with the same: Kr�fte he calls the same; and so we speak also in full-time Analogies of historical, intellectual forces, but in our case these imponderabilia follow one another so quickly that the crypts act according to laws, they still bear the character of the Zufalles in historians.

End paragraph 30

Early paragraph 31

And as in history, it has to be similar in all areas of humanistic research, because where the individual determines the individual events, they proceed relatively slowly. Languages and writings arise and pass by the fact that their development is carried out by the best possible changes in the use of life in the daily life. Which time periods are required to do so, this is not only an upper-fledgling protection, but certainly also here hundreds of thousands of years seem to have an unstoried effect, so that the speech could be mentioned by a law.

End paragraph 31

Early paragraph 32

As in history, it is possible to recognize the grammar, the grammar are examples, but how far is the path from these rules to a law of nature? However, we could also follow the development of a language to the end, so it would not have been possible yet; thousands of the same people we know to pronounce it as the law, as in the averages the next thousand will form.

End paragraph 32

Early paragraph 33

And so it may be in all areas where the human being and his activity form the individual event; indeed, I believe that in general the spiritual level of a people is going through the same development. From inferior probabilities, it goes through an infinite series of random events into more likely ones, from the almost equal level of animals and lower human species evolves all the way to the highest differentiated state of education and culture with all of his counter-puzzles. If we were not too much to leave the safe bottom of the numbers, so it would probably be tempting also the spiritual types with their laws, such as e.g. B. the styles in the different areas of art and their development to the same general cause.

Thus, it seems that there is a deep gap between the areas of the exact and the humanistic science, and yet the difference is only a gradual one, due to the different objects of research on both sides and through their Relationship to the lifespan of the human. But this is limited and given; very large it is against the individual events of the molecular world and therefore there are laws here; but small it is opposite to the development processes on humanistic territories and therefore there is no here Laws.

Early paragraph 35

This supremtity position of man in nature causes the difference; an intellect whose lifespan has been enough for the millions of years, for the next, this difference will disappear. Aptly says Schiller: " H�here spirits see the delicate spinnewts of an act through the entire stretching of the world system and perhaps to the most remote limits of the future and past-where man is nothing but the one in free L�ften the floating fact. "

However, we also find out how unjust the accusation is that the humanists do not have the results of their research into exact laws, and how hopeless it is to look for those in areas where they are not. there are none. The humanists are given to observe and study the individual events, which, although at the same time, certainly as much as the individual human life itself, which is also the product of the infestation; to us, which we are The legal average values are observed, is the insight into the individual properties of matter, as far as human foresight is enough, arguably for always failed.

Early paragraph 37

I was talking earlier about the apparent gap between exact and humanist research, as it may be most obvious when we see physics and history as the two reprents; I have this gulf an apparent called, because, in fact, it is not impossible to crumble. Between the two extremes can be found all the �berg�nge, from both sides one comes to meet. Are all natural sciences able to set up exact laws? By no means The so-called descriptive natural sciences such as botany, zoology, mineralogy, not minder geology or meteorology, as well as the whole range of medical disciplines, they all know no laws in the exact sense of the word, because on all these areas are followed by the individual events far too slowly. In botany and zoology, if they are the same descriptive nature, the life of the individual is the individual event; only in the course of geological epochs multiply the same in the way that, if not yet laws, however, Legal provisions are available. Here, too, we see the development from the more identical, that is, improbable state of the simple cells, to the more probable of the differentiated species and genera, as we know them today. Certainly the end of this development has not yet been reached, yes it can be said to be quite certain that it will never be achieved, for while all life is the most likely to be able to, the ��������er themselves Conditions, so that a different state of the most likely becomes the most likely before the first one is reached. Therefore, the extinction of species in the course of the geological epochs and the appearance of new ones, which again strive towards another end goal, in doing so seemingly following a certain determinant, in reality the laws of the Zufall.

End paragraph 37

Early paragraph 38

The constancy of our species in the course of the foreseeable times speaks for that quite probable increases are reached, but the calculation teaches that if these also occur by far the most frequently, we nevertheless from time to time also to less likely, deviating from it, meeting and even m�ssen, only these deviations will be the rarer ever more significant the amount of deviation. The Bohne develops in generations again and again to a Bohne, because that is their most likely development, but under the billions of cases, from time to time there are also too many deviations, mutations call them the biologist, which are so rare because they are unlikely to be so improbable, the greater the deviation. The fact that an apple tree plunges cherries is not impossible, it would only be such a strong deviation from the most likely trap that it is unlikely already over all Ma�s and their entrance to a miracle is equal, d. h. we think the case is practically unsuitable.

End paragraph 38

Early paragraph 39

The formation of the most probable condition, which corresponds to the rolling changes, is called adaptation when it concerns living organisms. However, the process is by no means limited to the living, it occurs just as well and from the very nature of the living organisms. same reason also in the dead matter. The fact that the water freezes at zero degrees is an adaptation to this temperature, because this particular arrangement of the molecules is not the only one possible at zero degrees; but probably by far the most probable. Thus, the theory of Descendence appears to us as a special case of the general law of truth.

End paragraph 39

Early paragraph 40

But if there are no laws in the descriptive botany and zoology, there are laws. Everyone knows the leaf of the oak and will know it from a hundred others, and yet no one is equal to the other. In size, weight and shape, fluctuations around a common type, which is the most likely for the matter among the surrounding areas under which it exists in the oak bar, are the most likely; and again there are small deviations from this More likely than large, so that we will never experience a oak to see Lindenbl�tter. So a certain legality is there, but not a law; we wanted to try such a thing, for example. For example, to set the weight of the leaves, so we could determine the average value of many millions of them, then we could say, the weight of the oak leaf is so and so large. But that does not apply again to the individual sheet, the weight of which is too low, but only for the average of the next millions, which we examine for example. We should always be able to act as a physical law if we are to become increasingly larger and larger than ever before, but without ever reaching it, because the number of oak blets around the world is still a lot is smaller than the number of molecules in the smallest open-eye still visible particles matter.

End paragraph 40

Early paragraph 41

Since there are a lot more plants and animals than humans, their lifespan is also a smaller one, so one understands the more steric emergence of laws in these areas over the humanistic; but strict laws are missing here like there. Only where the biologist or the physiologist is closer to the fields of molecular preferences, one will expect to meet with time on stricter laws, such as how it finds the mineralogist in the formation of crystals where it is is essentially molecular effects.

End paragraph 41

Early paragraph 42

One could be tempted by the lack of laws in the descriptive natural sciences of physics, to the effect of the living in contrast to the dead matter back; there is no reason to do so. The fact that not the nature of the events, but merely the number of them is the decisive moment, we see this in other natural sciences, which, like the physics, only deal with the dead matter, but nevertheless do not know any laws. A typical example of this is meteorology. Where does the proverbial unreliability come from the weather forecast? only from the too small number of individual events from which it is made available. Vienna has a certain mean annual temperature, derived from more than one hundred years of observations, but we can therefore claim that the mean annual temperature of the coming year will be so and so much? Certainly not; it will be true to this value and strong deviations from it will be unlikely, but with some certainty we can only say that on average of the next hundred years the temperature again show this value . But if the time scale collapsed so that we had a hundred years as a small fraction of a second appeared, then the low meteorological probability would go into physical certainty.

End paragraph 42

Early paragraph 43

But there are natural sciences in which the individual events are much more slow to follow one another; in geological processes, they can be separated from each other by millennials, and who wanted to enact the emergence of an earth in a law, the life story is not known by one, but by thousands of earth, in order to predict the average for the most thousands of times.

End paragraph 43

Early paragraph 44

Thus, the descriptive sciences are much more important to their nature in terms of human studies than physics, if they also, in fact, remove themselves from the objects of their research, far from it; they perform an ordeal part of the sacks, which are between the exact science and the humanities seems to be a gaping. But also from the other side, we will expect a penetration into these areas; only not all disciplines will be suitable for the formation of laws in the same way. Above all, we will expect them to be able to follow the events of the daily life in a rapid and rapid succession, in other places where the events of the daily life can be followed.

End paragraph 44

Early paragraph 45

I want to pick out a national economic example here. Money and money value changes the owner and steal; the guilder rolls, but according to which direction, that is the case of the trap. From the coincidence of the moment, it will be possible to see if someone buys a piece of bread or a hat and whether the gulden, which the stool occupies, moves on to a tailor or a cobbler. Of course, there are also these random circulations, which are caused by more important ones; one of the most powerful of these is, for example, the most important of these. For example, the tax, but since it always takes us away from a small fraction of the otherwise free possession, we do not want to influence its influence on the movement of money as a whole. If, however, the circulation is determined by chance, the laws of probability also apply. What kind of distribution of ownership must be? In the case of only a few individuals, they would be one of the most legitimate and lawless, but in a state the number of individual events may already be so large that there is a legal basis. The most probable condition for which such a relative distribution is sought is a very specific one, but is not, however, the synchronicity, which is rather unlikely, but rather that a certain size of possession, the The average value for most individuals is smaller and larger property, on the other hand, the more rare, the more they deviate from this mean, so that no possession or an enormously large amount of unprobable cases are at all. Without a doubt, this is the image of the modern state, but it certainly has not all been the time. In the case of unleavened veins, we find a much more equal distribution, which may have gone up to vague equality in primal times. But, as I said, one is an improbable one, and so the development here has taken its course according to the general law from the improbable to the probable. It is not possible to say whether the final state has been reached, since the statistics are unfortunately too deficient to compare the real state with the required exact situation, but in the large and whole, it probably confirms the drawn conclusions.

End paragraph 45

Early paragraph 46

If, however, the most likely distribution of the genes or a similar condition has occurred, it is not said that a particular individual has a specific possession over the duration, on the contrary, it follows with necessity that: The Tr�s of such a fortuous change their individuality; the poor will become rich and rich sexes become impoverish over time. What remains constant is the alleged distribution of possession among the individuals, but not the individual. There is still an important conclusion to be drawn from this: if the distribution of the goods is essentially based on chance, that is to say, with the necessity of a natural process, then we will also, as long as the state of culture remains the same, not to be able to do anything about it. What seems to be a natural necessity, that there is a lot of poverty and rich wealth side by side, one can see that it is enough to be wrong and the call for comparative justice, possibly after an equal distribution of possession, will be often collected. But that would also be unreasonable, as if one wanted to complain that the bricks of a new building did not go from themselves to the height. There is nothing to do with this distribution, because it is the necessary consequence of the respective cultural state; however, it is a matter of equality in distribution, but it is so enormously improbable that it will never happen by itself, and It is also possible to manufacture it in the near future, in the near future he would go back into natural inequality. But does it follow that you have to pay homage to the Kismet of the Orientals? I don't think so. It is in the human nature that each one is the next, not just every individual, but every stand, every society in the state, and that the good and "\i \" before the neighbour us goes as the fate of us unknown People. Thus, everyone will strive to influence the state in his favour, but what he gives himself, he needs to take on another, whose fate, his eyes, is equal to him. Thus social aspirations will not inhibit the course of nature, do not change the fate of the general public, and only those who like to give up utopias and not look beyond their next neighbourhood can believe by such means the lot of the To influence people constantly; but by law, you can't force the water to fly the mountain.

It is not here the place to comment on further consequences of this view, it would otherwise show. that some of the problems of the national economy are related to it. that, B. the tendency of the interest rate to decrease as a result of the progressive culture is a consequence of the all-time annuity of the most likely distribution of the genes. But I just wanted to say here that in the humanistic areas as well as in the descriptive natural sciences, legal issues are coming to the forework. if the case is in place, d. h. when a large number of individual events have an impact. Let us have a precise statistic of human possession and its distribution in different countries and times-which is theoretically possible-as well as in this area laws are drawn up which are the laws of the descriptive natural sciences completely equal.

And so the series of disciplines that encompass knowledge of the world of the eyes is continuously closed; nowhere do we see a principled difference, ��berall only a gradual, as it is given by the nature of the objects by itself is. If human studies do not provide such clear laws as physics, we know that this is with necessity in their essence and that the application of other methods does not allow anything to change, because where no laws are, neither can nor do any of the laws. *)

End paragraph 48

Early paragraph 49

*) In the series of disciplines raised here, perhaps one is missing, which is considered to be the prototype of the Exakness and whose laws are tainted with absolute truth, the mathematics. This alone is not in the realm of our contemplations, because their objects are not given in nature, they are purely conceptual; in nature there is no sphere, no circle, no straight line, and the laws that apply to these Structures do not come into being in nature, they lie in their definitions.

Early paragraph 50

When I briefly summarise what has been said, I come to the following conclusion: all events in nature are the result of events; the greater the number of individual events from which an appearance is under certain conditions. , the more likely it will have a certain character, the more likely it will become law-making. Is the probability that such a time arises so gro� that it becomes certainty for human terms, then we speak of a "law". However, this is only possible in the case of all the presentation of large numbers of individual events, as they occur in the case of molecular processes. In all other areas there are no laws, only laws, and these are all the more doubtful the smaller the number of events from which they are derived, in order to be able, in the case of too small a number of the same, to be inferred. To be published. The living does not matter, precisely the two endmembers of the series, physics and geology, have to do it exclusively with dead matter, but their time scales are different about everything Ma� and therefore the difference in their results.

Early paragraph 51

Very deficient, I know, it is the image that we are able to construct from what is happening in the world, but it is a perfectly unified and self-contained; it eliminates the old gap between the exact research and the Science does not know the strict laws; it shows that there are really exact laws of nature, that all human knowledge from the world of the eyes is different only by different degrees of probability. And these degrees are not conditioned by the nature of the research, they are given by the nature of the object of each discipline, and thus each joyful and jealous will recognize the results of the others. But our view also lets the whole world, that it be alive or dead, as a quite uniform recognition, a single law that is subject to the probability.

Early paragraph 52

And our alma mater, is it anything other than an image of this wide world? Isn't it a microcosm that includes everything that the world offers? Here, everyone who wants to prepare for the cramps of life, finds the world in front of itself, but not only the world as it is, but, and thus the university differs in principle from all other educational institutions, also the world like it has become. Only one goal can be seen in this, the sighting shows the most probable condition in each area, which is the most probable condition; only in this way we hope to take a look into the future. But is the university as an institution not itself the result of a centuries-long development? Of course, this is only the haste of a large number of random events, the effect of which the university, as it is now, has given rise to as the most appropriate state. But we know that such a development is only progressing as long as the more favourable conditions of the same do not change. Now, for the university, it has always existed until today, substantially only such a condition, which is adapted to all its constitution and its innermost being, that is the absolute freedom of research and teaching. As long as these remain, and it will be preserved, as long as our alma mater will be an always faithful image of the whole world: "glorious as in the first day".
