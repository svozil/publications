Refreshment</h2>
<!-- l. 135 --><p class='noindent'>In my experience, the best way to get to know a place is to explore
it on foot. Walking creates an immediate and visceral exposure to
the environment, quickly revealing its true character.
</p><!-- l. 137 --><p class='indent'>   This intimate exploration indeed becomes my downfall on
Bora Bora. My planned route appears straightforward on my
maps: crossing the island’s narrow side from Vaitape, the main
town, along a path less than ten kilometers wide.
</p><!-- l. 139 --><p class='indent'>   Starting from Vaitape on the west side, I intend to ascend a
steep slope, traverse the ridge, descend into the “Valley of the
Kings,” cross a low pass, and finally emerge on the east coast. On
the maps, the route looks deceptively simple—even accounting for
roots and bushes, the path seems navigable. By Vienna standards,
this would be a leisurely afternoon stroll, easily managed in
spring, autumn, or winter.
</p><!-- l. 141 --><p class='indent'>   My digital maps, all sourced from Open Street Map, precisely
indicate the route’s beginning: a long dead-end road at Vaitape’s
northern end, lined with traditional hut dwellings, leading directly
to a path ascending into the bush. As soon as I take my first steps
down this alley, however, the landscape’s true nature becomes
apparent.
</p><!-- l. 143 --><p class='indent'>   Dogs dominate the environment, barking from every direction.
Some emerge from gateless fences, advancing aggressively.
Locals have explained these dogs are kept “for protection” and
“for security,” though this seems at odds with widespread claims
that French Polynesia—at least outside Papeete—is entirely safe
                                                        
                                                        
and largely crime-free. Is this protective stance reserved
only for locals? Or perhaps something more complex is at
play.
</p><!-- l. 145 --><p class='indent'>   My speculation turns toward two potential explanations. First,
a pragmatic approach: residents might simply want to discourage
potential intrusions, creating a psychological barrier through their
canine sentinels. Alternatively, these dogs could represent an
externalized aggression—a “territorial” valve through which
suppressed tensions are released. Everywhere, “tapu” (taboo)
signs reinforce boundaries, prohibiting entry to various spaces and
properties.
</p><!-- l. 147 --><p class='indent'>   Undeterred, I continue walking, passing growling dogs
emerging from gardens. Suddenly, at the alley’s end, a pack of
different dogs circles me, barking menacingly. They seem
emboldened by their numbers, making me feel hunted. A sharp
pain strikes my right leg.
</p><!-- l. 149 --><p class='indent'>   The confrontation abruptly ends when a young Polynesian
sharply calls off his dogs. By then, I have already been bitten—a
small wound that does not bleed profusely. The local simply
shrugs and retreats, leaving one dog still growling in the middle of
the road. My anger rises, and I fantasize about retaliating with my
heavy hiking boots.
</p><!-- l. 151 --><p class='indent'>   Higher up the slope, I examine the wound: a bruise and a
tiny blood droplet. My American jeans have fortunately
dampened the bite, which seems more a deterrent than a
serious attack. A barefoot encounter would have been far more
dangerous.
</p><!-- l. 153 --><p class='indent'>   I later contact the Bora Bora ambulance and am greeted by a
reassuring French doctor who speaks English. She confirms no
                                                        
                                                        
dog rabies on the island but warns about potential infection risks.
Her advice is pragmatic: monitor small wounds or seek immediate
treatment if concerned. I choose to observe, treating the
bite areas with zinc ointment and tracking the developing
hematoma.
</p><!-- l. 155 --><p class='indent'>   Later, seeking understanding, I also contact the Tahitian tourist
office to discuss “the apparent dog situation”. They confirm the
widespread problem of dogs allowed to roam freely. The issue is
more serious than a mere nuisance—at one point, a person
had been killed by these uncontrolled packs, and serious
injuries occurred with disturbing frequency. My minor bite, it
seems, is just one symptom of a larger, more dangerous urban
wildlife problem that local authorities have yet to effectively
address.
</p><!-- l. 157 --><p class='indent'>   With the dog encounter behind me, I venture into the
bushes. The initially clear path quickly deteriorates—trash
litters the muddy slope, obscuring the route to the ridge. In an
upper clearing, I consult my map, and—perhaps in revenge
for the dog bite—pluck a massive avocado hanging from a
nearby tree, adding unexpected weight to my already heavy
backpack
</p><!-- l. 159 --><p class='indent'>   <img alt='PIC' src='image-2023-bb-20231218_134531.jpg' />
</p><!-- l. 161 --><p class='indent'>   Where I am supposed to go according to the trail data on the
map, there is only dense undergrowth. To make matters worse, I
start sweating from every pore without cooling down.
</p><!-- l. 163 --><p class='indent'>   Due to the previous rain and the sun, the water on the ground
and on the leafs now begins to evaporate, causing the air’s water
vapor saturation to reach one hundred percent. As a result, the
cooling mechanism of the skin through evaporation no longer
                                                        
                                                        
works. People like me simply do not cool down.
</p><!-- l. 165 --><p class='indent'>   This has nothing to do with my birthday today, which
catapults me into an unimaginably Methuselah-like age. Evil
tongues claim that this is precisely why I drove close to the
international date line—to stay eleven hours younger than I
actually am. In Auckland, it would have been the other way
around!
</p><!-- l. 167 --><p class='indent'>   Be that as it may, I am seriously considering, in the middle of
the climb, whether I will even manage to climb this mini slope of
about 150 meters. I am experiencing the feeling of age, or of not
being able to walk anymore. Just last summer, I experienced
something similar with a tourist on the way down from the
Schafberg: the poor woman had taken the cable car up and then
wanted to walk the 1300 meters downhill herself. You hardly ever
allow yourself anything else! As I dashed past, balancing over hill
and dale, her partner tried to give her a piggyback ride for a few
meters! I do not know how she ever found her way back to St.
Wolfgang in that state. I certainly did not read anything about it in
the newspaper!
</p><!-- l. 169 --><p class='indent'>   That is more or less how I feel as I climb up this little slope,
pausing every five to ten meters, in 100 percent humidity.
Meanwhile, a muddy track coincides with the route marked on
the map. That is why I follow it. In particularly steep and
slippery places, ropes are attached, which I gratefully use for
support.
</p><!-- l. 171 --><p class='indent'>   I come across a tree with giant avocados, under which
there are rusting oil drums. Out of a feeling of “revenge” on
everything, I pick one that is probably still unripe, but temptingly
hanging in front of me, and I stuff it into my already quite full
                                                        
                                                        
backpack.
</p><!-- l. 173 --><p class='indent'>   You would not believe it: after not long and several breaks,
I reach the ridge and turn right, following a well-trodden
path.
</p><!-- l. 175 --><p class='indent'>   Suddenly, completely unexpectedly, like manna to the
Israelites, a bright yellow mango appears on the ground.
Then another and another. The whole ground is covered with
medium-sized, bright golden yellow mangos! Some of them have
already been nibbled on by ants and other insects, but most still
have their skin intact, and the flesh is revealed once you
peel off the skin. I eat almost all of the ones I find in the
area—there must be about twenty of them—and pack three
more in my backpack for later. The hike is starting to be
fun!
</p><!-- l. 177 --><p class='indent'>   <img alt='PIC' src='image-2023-bb-20231218_143939.jpg' />
</p><!-- l. 179 --><p class='indent'>   I do not want to go into any more detail here, just this
much: the path is good at first, up to a point with a view
of Fa’anui, the second largest town on the island. Then it
becomes problematic again because it is hardly used. After a bit
of back and forth, I find the path again. On the way down
from the ridge, I pass a large rock with a small waterfall
quite far down. Below it is a brownish natural pool. I hear
the happy laughter of children from far away. In fact, a few
young boys and two dogs are climbing around on the rock.
I take off my jeans and swim a little in the murky water.
There is no cooling off again, but at least I feel like I have
bathed.
</p><!-- l. 181 --><p class='indent'>   The guys give me water—I do not have enough with me—and
offer me two grapefruits. They then shake a papaya tree until it
                                                        
                                                        
reveals its ripe fruit. This, too, disappears into my backpack as a
donation.
</p><!-- l. 183 --><p class='indent'>   I then part ways with the nice company that is leading me to
the Valley of the Kings. After a while, I come to a clearing and
take a small side path. It takes me a while to realize that
at the end of it, there is a huge banyan tree growing over
black granite rocks, said to have grown around and integrated
several royal mummies buried upright over time. I slide further
across lush meadows with fruit trees and then come to a flat
place, a marae, where the Polynesians used to live. Then,
after a small detour, I continue along the power line to the
Traversale pass and finally down to the sea on the east side of the
island.
</p><!-- l. 185 --><p class='indent'>   A friendly employee of a luxury resort picks me up after only a
short time standing on the circulation road in her car. She cannot
believe the tour I have just done.
