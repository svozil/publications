<!-- l. 379 --><p class='noindent'>The situation has hardly changed since Gauguin: Many
Polynesians live in corrugated iron huts, which, together
with the “front gardens”, appear incredibly neglected. The
French are “running” the island, which the Polynesians turn
up their noses at, but they know that they are better off in
the end than if they were in charge of the administration
alone.
</p><!-- l. 381 --><p class='indent'>   The only international airport in this island kingdom, Fa’a’a,
has no air conditioning. Occasionally, fans swirl the hot air,
which is completely saturated with water vapor. Papeete’s
town hall has a clock tower that probably stopped at some
point after the French handed the islands over to the locals in
1984. Apparently, no one cares what time it is: the clock
shows 7:38, and since then time has stood immovably still
there.
</p><!-- l. 383 --><p class='indent'>   This jammed clock is probably a symbol and warning sign of
the general depravity that the locals are struggling with. Nobody
cares about the dogs that are roaming around everywhere,
often leading a miserable existence, about the screeching
roosters and the poultry, about the manure in the gardens and
courtyards: what is considered “hoarding” in Europe is the norm
here.
</p><!-- l. 385 --><p class='indent'>   I think the French have given up on colonialism with a shudder
and now only take what they need, without any pretense of
statehood. In the end, French Polynesia was probably just too
expensive for them and they got rid of it like a hot potato.
                                                        
                                                        
Officially, however, they were politically correct in their
decolonial and deconstructive attitude. Derrida and Foucault
would certainly be delighted with that and would babble about it
in a weighty, sophistical way!
