``perfect context mismatchbetween preparation and measurement,'' using
jonjugate bases, such as ...
light from a linear polarized source is split into two beams of equal
 intensity, each having a polarization direction of $\pm 45^\circ $
 with respect to the original direction of polarization. Incoming light
 quanta are then detected. Subsequent countings in detectors 0 and 1
 correspond to subsequent bits of a sequence $\psi (n)$
(after Von Neumann-type normalization).

\begin{itemize}
\item<+->
(H. Everett), Tommaso Toffoli, KS, Otto R\"ossler: operational observables ``within'' a system.

\item<+->
G\"odel  in a reply to a letter by A. W. Burks, reprinted in [J. von Neumann, Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata, University of Illinois
Press, Urbana, 1966, a. W. Burks, editor.]: \textcolor{blue}{{\em ``I think the
theorem of mine which von Neumann refers to is ... the fact that a complete epistemological description of a language A cannot be given in the same language A,
because the concept of truth of sentences of A cannot be defined in A. It is this
theorem which is the true reason for the existence of undecidable propositions in the
formal systems containing arithmetic.''} }

{bf 1} (2 \& 3),  {117-133} \& {173-195}, 1950

Embedding a Turing machine into a physical system: e.g.,
Christopher D. Moore, {``Unpredictability and undecidability in dynamical systems''},
{Physical Review Letters} {\bf 64}, {2354-2357}, 1990

G\"odel himself does not believe in relevance for physics (recollection of J.A.Wheeler)

\item<+->
Recursive unsolvability of the Rule Inference Problem.

\item<+-> J. Casti, two conferences on the topic (Santa Fe 1994 \& Abisko 1996): finally decides that
\textcolor{red}{``undecidability in physics is a Red Herring.''}

\section{``Classical'' indeterminsm \& randomness}

\subsection{Chaitin-Kolmogorov type randomness}
\frame{
\frametitle{Chaitin-Kolmogorov type randomness}

\begin{itemize}
\item<+->
Algorithmic incompressibility: ``in the limit''
the minimal algorithmic description length
(``Algorithmic Information'')
of a random string increases linearly with the string length.

\item<+->
Equivalent to all statistical tests of randomness (Martin-L\"of--Solovay randomness).

\item<+->
Algorithmic Information is generally undecidable (``reduction to the halting problem''; see also
Busy Beaver function)


\item<+->
Example: take \fcolorbox{yellow}{yellow}{7687675545646} positions in the decimal expansion of $\pi$, starting from the
\fcolorbox{yellow}{yellow}{143464668788978979797767655454475676879879787900}th position. Fapp random (eg, Borel normal), but not random against the hypothesis mentioned.

Classical physical indeterminism (eg ``chaos'') $=$ uncomputability

``With probability'' one, elements of the continuum are uncomputable.

How does one ``grab'' such elements? Necessity of the Axiom of Choice?

How come we cannot exploit these trans-Turing capabilities of classical continua?

\frame{
\frametitle{My vision}

\begin{itemize}
\item<+->
Total discretization of QPhysics (Einstein's vision),
but not in configuration space. Space-time
is an idealistic concept generated by conventions (cf. Alexandrov's theorem).


\item<+->
Value definiteness of a QSystem is defined in a single context;
this information may be imprinted and distributed over several ``entangled quanta;''
other contexts remain undefined.


\item<+->
Evoution ist stricly a permutation; i.e.,  one-to-one.
``Measurements'' are purely conventional; i.e., a matter of where and how one
conceptualizes the ``cut'' or interfache between ``observer'' \& object.

\item<+->
In case of context mismatch between preparation and measurement,
a context translation occurs \& quasi-randomness is introduced (Malus law).
