<!-- l. 342 --><p class='noindent'>A remarkable scene unfolds next door: a family—father, mother,
and two daughters, around 9 and 12 years old—are enjoying two
pizzas together for dinner in front of their bungalow.
</p><!-- l. 344 --><p class='indent'>   The daughters have made themselves comfortable on the most
plush, padded loungers, relaxing without a care. The mother,
however, sits on a simple wooden chair that offers little in the way
of comfort. The father, who is probably the one funding the entire
experience, does not even have a proper seat at first. During the
meal, he settles on a narrow stone staircase. The way it is
positioned forces him to twist his body unnaturally in order to face
his family.
</p><!-- l. 346 --><p class='indent'>   After dinner, he rises and moves to sit on the armrest of one of
his daughter’s beach chairs. He chats cheerfully, relaxed as can
be—one might imagine him, to paraphrase Camus, as a happy and
contented person.
</p><!-- l. 348 --><p class='indent'>   Then, suddenly, the mood shifts: one of the daughters begins to
cry. It is not a quiet sob, but an intense, guttural cry, filled with raw
emotion and grief. She is practically shaking with sorrow.
Meanwhile, the other daughter, seemingly unaffected, giggles
happily to herself, her carefree laughter in stark contrast to her
sister’s distress. Eventually, both emotions fade as they drift off to
sleep.
