<!-- l. 288 --><p class='noindent'>On Christmas Day, December 25th, the sky unexpectedly clears
after a week of intermittent rain. As I receive my breakfast, I can
hardly believe my luck: I can even see blue skies!
</p><!-- l. 290 --><p class='indent'>   This, of course, motivates me to make the most of the day with
water activities. So, I quickly slurp down my magnesium-vitamin
C water and the somewhat peculiar coffee offered to me—one I
don’t want to discard out of convenience. After successfully
relieving myself, I don my long black New Zealand sports
trousers, a long-sleeved black sports T-shirt, diving shoes
(which prove very important later), and two hats—one being a
wide-brimmed fisherman’s hat from China (everything I wear and
use is from China anyway, including the air mattress). I tuck the
yellow air mattress under my arm.
</p><!-- l. 292 --><p class='indent'>   Before heading out, I apply a generous amount of UV
sunscreen, followed by extra titanium dioxide on areas not covered
by clothing, ensuring I am well-protected from the sun’s
rays.
</p><!-- l. 294 --><p class='indent'>   I make my way towards “Matira Point,” located at the tip of a
spike of land jutting into the sea, towards a motu (small island)
known for its “coral garden”. I have already seen the bay and the
surrounding path from above while walking to a cellphone tower
on a hill. I figure I can reach the spot nearly without swimming,
simply by “water walking”.
</p><!-- l. 296 --><p class='indent'>   Matira Point itself is marked off with private signs saying
“tapu” (forbidden), “off-limits,” and “dogs”. So, I enter the water
just before the point, at a boat dock on the left. I wouldn’t
                                                        
                                                        
recommend attempting this water walk without diving shoes or at
least running shoes with thick street soles, as there are an
abundance of sea urchins, and I’m constantly stepping on
coral.
</p><!-- l. 298 --><p class='indent'>   However, the landscape is absolutely breathtaking when the
sea is calm! The water is crystal clear, transitioning from light
green to azure blue, with the bottom often covered in bright white
sand. On the left, the volcanic mountains rise, their peaks often
shrouded in clouds. The highest of these is Mont Otemanu, with
its almost square top and steep, nearly vertical edges. To the right,
the islands of Raiatea and Taha’a are visible. The sight is
truly magnificent in such weather: calm, gentle waves and
sunshine. I’m also wearing tinted polycarbonate glasses,
closed on the sides, similar to those used by workers in New
Zealand. Without these, I’d barely be able to tolerate the intense
light! Alternatively, one could wear regular sunglasses along
with untinted polycarbonate safety glasses that block UV
light.
</p><!-- l. 300 --><p class='indent'>   On the air mattress, I have brought a bottle of fresh water—one I
plan to greedily drink later—as well as two pairs of diving
goggles, one of which comes with a snorkel.
</p><!-- l. 302 --><p class='indent'>   The spot I’m aiming for is easy to locate, as there are several
small and large observation boats anchored nearby. As I draw
closer, I see snorkelers frolicking in the water.
</p><!-- l. 304 --><p class='indent'>   However, about two-thirds of the way there (approximately
500 meters in total), the water has risen nearly to my neck. Maybe
I misjudged something, or perhaps I did not follow the shallow
part of the bay? Either way, the water is lukewarm, and I
swim slowly towards the boats. Or rather, I hold onto the
                                                        
                                                        
ends of the air mattress, using my feet to paddle through the
water.
</p><!-- l. 306 --><p class='indent'>   As I approach, I hear the loud, happy shrieks of my fellow
snorkelers. I pull my goggles from the air mattress, place them on,
and slip on my snorkel. Almost immediately, I spot the first
“boulders” or submerged elevations, with a variety of fish
swimming around.
</p><!-- l. 308 --><p class='indent'>   At first, I think to myself: “Well, this is not much better than
anywhere else”. But the longer I snorkel, the more diverse and
beautiful the scene becomes. The coral garden is vibrant, with
many species of fish in various patterns and colors. The name truly
fits: it is like a large aquarium!
</p><!-- l. 310 --><p class='indent'>   Groups of tourists are constantly being ushered in and out of
the water, often with crude comments like, “Fish nice, eh?” or
“Bora Bora nice, you like?” which does not bother me in the
slightest.
</p><!-- l. 312 --><p class='indent'>   By the way, there are some very cheeky little fish here that are
not shy about nibbling at your legs if you remain still for too long.
They are small, flattened, black with a golden shimmer on their
sides. Here, it seems, everyone eats whatever they can grab. Next
time, I intend to bring a baguette with me, as a tour operator here
suggested. In Thailand, they throw fish food into the sea to
give tourists something to talk about when they get home.
Austrian chocolate slices were also quite popular with the fish
there!
</p><!-- l. 315 --><p class='indent'>   Once I have had enough of swimming among the coral reefs, I
decide to visit a small motu that my host recommended to me,
which is not too far away. She claimed there are beautiful corals
there as well. Unfortunately, this information turns out to be
                                                        
                                                        
inaccurate, but the journey and the destination prove interesting all
the same.
</p><!-- l. 318 --><p class='indent'>   I have to swim farther than I anticipated until the ground
becomes shallow enough for me to walk. It is tiring, though, as
each step is met with resistance from the water—a kind of “snow
walk!” But corals are everywhere on the sandy bottom. Without
diving shoes or thick-soled sneakers, I would not be able to
manage!
</p><!-- l. 321 --><p class='indent'>   The coral reefs here are smaller and simply a reflection of the
aquarium I just left. As I approach the motu, a local woman points
to a fin sticking out of the water and calls, “Shark!” I hastily try to
reach dry land.
</p><!-- l. 323 --><p class='indent'>   Sure enough, she later shows me the young shark swimming
lazily around. It is likely there to “clean up” discarded mussels,
which the locals extract from the rocks with flathead screwdrivers.
A small ray also appears. From my observation, rays are often
present when there’s something to clean up!
</p><!-- l. 325 --><p class='indent'>   The motu is only about 20 meters from the reef, and I notice
two people walking along the reef. That is exactly where I want to
go! The reef forms an interface or boundary between the deep
South Pacific and the shallow atoll. Good shoes are essential here,
as the bottom is covered with coral and sharp edges. I place my air
mattress in a pool of water with rather dull edges and set off on a
short walk. As the local man returning from his own walk
explains, it is a calm day, and he has gathered a good number of
mussels—his back pocket is overflowing with them. But,
from my perspective, the water here seems anything but
calm. At one point, I lose my footing due to the force of
the water lapping against the atoll. Thankfully, I manage
                                                        
                                                        
to steady myself without injury. Sharp, jagged edges are
everywhere!
</p><!-- l. 327 --><p class='indent'>   Finally, I reach the ridge, about five meters wide. It sinks
slightly when I stand on it, with the sea roaring in from Raiatea
and Taha’a. Thick clouds hang over both islands, and I can see
streams of rainwater cascading down the slopes. It is even
possible to do a reef hike from here to the next motu—the
reef is flat and gentle, though likely yielding. One wonders
what it would be like to be washed out to open sea from
here!
</p><!-- l. 329 --><p class='indent'>   I turn around and slide back toward the motu, retrieve my
air mattress, and ask a local if it is okay to walk or swim
towards Matira Beach. He does not understand me at first but
eventually tells me that I can swim first, as it is still deep
enough, and then I can walk in the water. So, I leave the motu,
heading towards the hotel, happily letting the tailwind carry me
along, especially as the clouds from Raiatea and Taha’a grow
thicker.
</p><!-- l. 331 --><p class='indent'>   Upon reaching the beach, I spot a French tourist, her face
bright red, taking photos with her mobile phone.
</p><!-- l. 333 --><p class='indent'>   The next day, I attempt to visit the coral garden again.
This time, however, the wind is so strong that the waves are
half a meter high even within the atoll, and my air mattress
stands up like a sail. With considerable effort, I manage to
get close to the coral garden, but then I’m picked up by an
American from San Diego, who is using two boats from a
luxury hotel with his family. He kindly takes me back to the
hotel.
</p><!-- l. 335 --><p class='indent'>   Water has seeped into my cellphone case without causing any
                                                        
                                                        
noticeable damage. When I attempt to climb up the boat ladder, I
injure my finger. I realize: once again, Americans have “saved”
me, making possible what I would not have been able to do on my
own.
