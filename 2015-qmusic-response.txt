Dear Editors,

we kindly thank the Referee for the valuable comments and suggestions.

We have revised the manuscript accordingly; in particular, we have added a note
on the full chromatic scale at the end of page one,
as well as in the summary section (first question/suggestion),
where we have also emphasized that we intended to propose the basic ideas for a new kind of
(quantum) music by presenting a quantization of music (second question/suggestion).

We hope that the manuscript can be published in its present form.

Please contact us should further revisions be necessary.

Thank you for all your attention and efforts.

Yours Sincerely,

Volkmar Putz and Karl Svozil
