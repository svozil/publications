Dear Professor Dr. Benguria,

thank you and the anonymous Referee for the attention dedicated to the manuscript, and for the valuable comments and suggestions!

We have now revised the manuscript according to these corrections, comments and suggestions as follows:

*) Corrected all misspellings and typos at various occations;

*) Changed "The hypergraphs representing quantum observables are on a set of atoms—as its vertex set—faithfully represented in an n-dimensional Hilbert space."

*) Changed the wording of  Criterion 1 to resolve an issue in the wording raised by the Referee.

*) Changed "The hypergraphs considered here are based on graphs containing cliques on k vertices."

*) Unfortunately, the TITS graph suggested by the Referee is separable, as v(b)=1 (and thus the remaining vertices in that context have a two-valued state assignment 0) would not imply that v(a)=1, since it cannot be excluded that v(a)=0, thereby separating a from b. Indeed, we checked that, if the snake-like edges are identified with two Specker bug TIFS'es, the suggested graph has a separating set of  121 two-valued states.

*) Changed "can only be met for"

*) Changed three occurrences of "coil-shaped" into "snake-shaped"

*) Changed part of the caption of "Figure 2.  A layer hypergraph serving..."

*) Changed "For an(a,b)-TIFS gadget G, the set of two-valued states are nonempty.  Let s1 be those states in which a is true, s2 be those states that b is true and s3 be those states in which both a and b are false. Then {s1,s2,s3} partitions the set of two-valued states of G."

*) Modified the consideration of Case 1 according to the question and suggestion of the Referee.

*) Changed "whose all vertices are on at least one maximal clique"

*) Clarified some formulations to increase readability and comprehensiveness.

We hope that, with these modifications, the manuscript can be accepted in Journal of Mathematical Physics.

Please do not hesitate to contact us again should any further questions come up.

We would also kindly like to point out that FWF allows the open access option.

Thank you and the Referee again for all your kind criticism, suggestions, and efforts!

Yours sincerely,

Mohammad Hadi Shekarriz and Karl Svozil
