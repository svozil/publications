ABSTRACT = {Functional epistemology is about ways to access functional objects by using varieties of methods and procedures. Not all such means are equally capable of reproducing these functions in the desired consistency and resolution. Dyson&rsquo;s argument against the perturbative expansion of quantum field theoretic terms, in a radical form (never pursued by Dyson), is an example of epistemology taken as ontology.},
