Response to the second report of the first Referee
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Referee states:

"This version of the manuscript has improved the readability of the
text and better conveys the achievements of the paper. The abstract
now summarizes the work done in the manuscript. I am glad the authors
acknowledge the relation between pseudocontexts and operational
equivalences in Spekkens' contextuality, and the one between their
results and assessments of Spekkens' contextuality thereof. However, I
am afraid that once the claim of novelty has been debunked, the paper
does not stand relevant enough to yield a publication in PRA as it is.
In particular, if indeed Spekkens' contextuality is what is being
witnessed by the results, some points require attention:

1. As far as I am aware, the notion of "state-independent"
contextuality does not appear in Spekkens' framework. On the other
hand, the hypergraph framework employed in the paper
(McKay-Megill-Pavicic) seems to be concerned specifically with
state-independent assessments, and in Sec. V the authors say "The
observed scenario can be understood in the framework of Spekkens'
contextuality", and then "The type of contextuality introduced earlier
is independent of the preparation procedure". How to make sense out of
these two statements? Is it the case that considering pseudocontexts
in a hypergraph (and therefore operational equivalences in the quantum
scenario) impacts this "state-independency" somehow?"


We have incorporated a comparison with Spekkens' concepts of contextuality, one of which, as noted in the  manuscript, pertains to probabilistic distinctions between classical and quantum predictions.

However, the analogy ends here. The form of contextuality we introduce is probabilistic, but it has not been explored by Spekkens. He actually provided a comprehensive framework without anticipating our specific findings.

The Referee now appears to suggest that, by agreeing to incorporate this framework of Spekkens---quoting from the report---"the assertion of novelty has been debunked."

We respectfully disagree; referencing a general framework does not negate the novelty and significance of our contribution.

On the contrary, as the Referee acknowledges, certain aspects of the novel form of contextuality that we present were not anticipated by Spekkens' framework, as highlighted in the reference to "state-independence".

Therefore, we do not perceive any discrepancy that requires clarification or reconciliation---or that needs to be "made sense ... of".

We also disagree with the assertion that we utilized a hypergraph framework following McKay-Megill-Pavicic. In fact, we employed a standard mathematical definition as introduced in Ref. [7]:

A. Bretto, "Hypergraph theory," Mathematical Engineering (Springer, Cham, Heidelberg, New York, Dordrecht, London, 2013).

Furthermore, we referenced diagrammatic concepts of Greechie~\cite{greechie:71} and McKay-Megill-Pavicic~\cite{Mckay2000} for historical context and completeness.

Nevertheless, to seamlessly integrate and distinguish our notion(s) of contextuality from Spekkens', we have included the following sentence:

"While the specific concept of contextuality introduced here can be considered within this statistical framework, it retains its independent standing, encompassing novel properties among collections of observables."

The Referee states:

"2 (and most important). There are some graph-theoretical results to
contextuality (KS or Spekkens) beyond the MMP approach in the
literature, for instance:

* B. Amaral, M. T. Cunha, On Graph Approaches to Contextuality and
their Role in Quantum Theory, Springer (2018);

* A. Acín, T. Fritz, A. Leverrier, A. B. Sainz, Comm. Mat. Phys. 334,
p. 553-628 (2015);

* R. Wagner, R. S. Barbosa, E. F. Galvão,
https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02670 (2022).

What are the interesting/advantageous aspects of the approach employed
in the manuscript when compared to preexisting approaches? Notice that
since you dropped the claim of novelty, arguments for the relevance of
this work are much needed, and I believe they could stem from this
contrast."

We have added a sentence with the papers suggested by the Referee, and other papers, to eludicate this point:

"While the specific concept of contextuality introduced here can be considered within this statistical framework, it retains its independent standing, encompassing novel properties among collections of observables.  The same holds true when compared to the varieties of contextuality that can be expressed in and linked to (hyper)graphs discussed previously~\cite{acin-2015,amaral-2018,svozil-2017-b,cabello2021contextuality,Wagner2022Sep,Pavicic_2023}."

The Referee states:

"3. Concerning the new title, "Form of contextuality predicting
probabilistic equivalences (...)" sounds incorrect, since
contextuality is not what predicts this equivalence, but rather the
other way around -- one needs equivalences to expect a noncontextual
explanation to a prepare-and-measure scenario, and contextuality is
the impossibility of that. The probabilistic equivalences come from
normalization and exclusivity assumptions imposed over the hypergraph,
not from any assumption of noncontextuality. In a certain way, this
sounds similar to saying "Form of nonlocality predicting equivalences
between marginal distributions of space-like separated measurement
outcomes"."

We sincerely find the argument unclear. The title remained unchanged in the revised version.

The Referee states:

"4. It is difficult to assess how the analysis of such an elaborate
hypergraph as Example 2 is currently relevant for the quantum
foundations' community since the only two references motivating its
interest date from 1995 and 2000 are both works by one of the authors
of the current manuscript. Given that the lengthy calculations and
appendices referring to this Example yield essentially the same
conclusions as the previous one, such an extension of an already long
paper should be better justified."

We hold a different perspective on this matter. Our presentation revolves around a quantized system, offering a unique discussion on quantum mechanical realizations and predictions that sets it apart from existing literature.
The Referee states:

"Once the above points have been properly addressed and the advantages
of the methods employed by the authors over other graph-theoretical
approaches, I believe the paper should be fit for publication in PRA,
but there is still some work to be done."

We once again express our gratitude to the Referee for the valuable suggestions, comments, criticisms, and dedicated efforts in evaluating this manuscript. However, we respectfully disagree with certain aspects of the evaluation.

Acknowledging these disagreements, we have made efforts in the revised version to address any potential misunderstandings.

Response to the first report of the second Referee
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Referee states:

"I have only one real criticism to offer: The description of the
analytical approach applied to the first hypergraph (page 4, second
column onwards) seems somewhat ad-hoc to me. Can the approach be
formalized somehow, or will we need to do this "by hand" as it were
for any other hypergraphs that may be of interest to us? For that
matter, is there a way of telling, without exhaustive testing, which
values for alpha will work?

Other than the above, the article is well-written and reasonably easy
to follow, whilst the result is interesting and potentially quite
useful. In my opinion, it warrants publication in Physical Review A as
is, even if the analytical approach cannot be made more stringent."

We thank the Referee for his evaluation, and the suggestion made.

In response to this suggestion we have added the following paragraphs:


"While there is currently no systematic method for the coordinatization of general hypergraphs, we will additionally present an ad hoc analytical approach for generating a continuum of FORs that differ from those obtained heuristically. This method can be extended to establish a coordinatization for an enlarged hypergraph, encompassing a novel `combo' combination of structures discussed in the next section. This combination poses a greater challenge, prompting us to employ specific  analytically obtained FORs to facilitate a seamless continuation, leveraging rotational symmetry as a simplifying tool.

Degenerate cases necessitate individual computations for each coordinatization, typically done manually and potentially with the aid of computer algebra. Some of these cases can be anticipated from the hypergraph itself, without explicit reference to the specific vector representation. However, a thorough analysis is indispensable to identify all potential undesirable relations, such as equalities and orthogonalities, in order to describe all singular configurations accurately.


We sincerely hope that with these additions, the manuscript can be considered for publication.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Referees and Editors for their attention and efforts dedicated to reviewing the manuscript.

Response to the first report of the first Referee

The Referee report has been very helpful to improve the manuscript, in particular, to put the findings in context, and to eliminate some errors in formulae and in the text.

The Referee states:

"Although the work is mathematically correct and original to the best
of my knowledge, the paper struggles to convey the novelty of its
results. The claimed novel form of contextuality would come from the
fact that quantum realizations of the hypergraph satisfying the
equivalence constraints cannot violate a particular bound over a
linear combination of probabilities, while classical realizations can.
In my understanding, this is just a particular case of Spekkens
contextuality, in which the equivalence from the "pseudocontexts" is
just an equivalence class satisfied by the quantum measurements. They
fail to violate the inequality because the statistics coming from
these measurements cannot be explained by the ontological model (the
classical realization of the hypergraph)."

We fully agree with the report. We therefore have integrated our form of measurement contextuality with Spekken's approach, published in DOI /10.1103/PhysRevA.71.052108.

In particular, we have added respective paragraphs referring to Spekkens; one in the introduction:
"To address these situations, Spekkens has classified contex-
tuality in terms of operational equivalence of, say, measure-
ment outcomes, thereby also accommodating statistical forms
of contextual behavior [1]. Remarkably, these weaker sta-
tistical forms of contextuality, even though they can be repre-
sented using sets and faithfully embedded into Boolean alge-
bras, include complementary observables that are not jointly
measurable. When realized in a quantum context, they result
in probabilities that differ from those in classical realizations.
The significance of these statistical contextual variations lies
in their potential for experimental verification (subject to the
assumptions such as counterfactuals), as opposed to relying
on theoretical proofs employing reductio ad absurdum (proof
by contradiction).
In the following sections, we will present a type of contex-
tuality falling within the realm of weak contextuality. This
classification arises from the fact that its set of observables
is both complementary and set-representable. However, clas-
sical ontologic models provide statistical predictions that di-
verge from those derived using quantum probabilities."

and at the end, in the Discussion section of the manuscript:

"The observed scenario can be understood within the frame-
work of Spekkens contextuality [1], a broader concept that
extends the initial understanding of contextuality within quan-
tum theory. Measurement contextuality highlights differing
statistical predictions across various models, particularly con-
cerning quantized systems and classical ontological models.
The type of measurement contextuality introduced earlier
is independent of the preparation procedure. We can estab-
lish equivalence between measurement procedures by sum-
ming the probabilities of elements within their corresponding
pseudocontexts. This summation process enables us to define
equivalence relations among measurements, resulting in the
formation of distinct equivalence classes.
This form of contextuality arises from the observation that
quantum realizations of the hypergraph defining the pseudo-
contexts, which adhere to the equivalence constraints, do not
violate a specific bound on the sum of probabilities within
these pseudocontexts. In contrast, classical realizations can
exceed this bound."

The Referee noted errors throughout the manuscript that could have compromised
its comprehension. Therefore we have made the following changes and corrections:

"- In equation 1, the coverings indicated in the summations' subscripts
are probably swapped;"

We have corrected the swapped sums of contexts in equation (1), as noted by the Referee.

"- On page 4, first paragraph in the left column, the text says "(...)
basis vectors forming the four contexts or blocks (...)" and then
mentions only two of the four contexts;"

We have changed "four" to "two" as noted by the Referee.

- The hyperlink in Ref. 17 does not lead to a reference. This is
particularly relevant since this is one of the only 2 applications
cited to justify the interest in the hypergraph from section IV.

We have re-checked the hyperlink. Hopefully the issue mentioned by the Referee is now overcome. If not, we must make sure that, in a final
published version the correct hyperlink

http://www.numdam.org/item/AIHPA_1995__63_2_155_0/

is inserted.

Furthermore the Referee noted:

"The abstract needs to be improved to contextualize the result in the
field and describe better what has been done in the manuscript."

We have now completely rewritten and extended the Abstract with this observation of the Referee in mind; hopefully it describes the content of the manuscript as follows:

"We introduce a contextual quantum system comprising mutually complementary observables organized into
two or more collections of pseudocontexts with the same probability sums of outcomes. These pseudocontexts
constitute non-orthogonal bases within the Hilbert space, featuring a state-independent sum of probabilities. In
other words, regardless of the initial state preparation, the total probability remains constant but distinct from
unity. The measurement contextuality in this setup arises from the quantum realizations of the hypergraph,
which adhere to a specific bound on the linear combination of probabilities. In contrast, classical realizations
can surpass this bound. The violation of quantum bounds stems from the inability of classical ontological mod-
els, specifically the set theoretic representation of the hypergraph corresponding to the quantum observables
collections, to adhere to and explain the observed statistics."

The Referee also mentioned that the
text displays instances of informal English (such as the recurrent use
of "aka" as an acronym to "also known as") that need to be addressed
to fit the criteria of Physical Review journals.

We have gone through the manuscript and eliminated all "aka"s, and have tried to make the text through small changes in grammar more complient with PRA standard of expression ond form.

We have also added one observation:

"Equality of the probability sums across pseudocontexts is only possible when considering more than two observables (e.g., triples) within each pseudocontext and in Hilbert spaces of dimensions greater than two. This restriction arises from the inherent impossibility of intertwining edges with fewer than three observables."

The Referee also pointed out that the text could do
more to explain why physicists should be interested in studying these
particular hypergraphs.

We hope that through the discussion of Spekken's approach, and the added paragraphs mentioned earlier we have contributed toward a better physical motivation. Moreover, we have added the following paragraphs:

"Pseudocontexts in general, and the statistical equivalence
of pseudocontexts in particular, have the potential to serve as
valuable tools for studying quantized systems beyond merely
certifying their non-classical nature. These pseudocontexts
can be correlated with non-orthogonal bases in Hilbert space,
and, due to the preparation independence of their probability
sums, represent generalizations of orthogonal frames."

Overall we would like to thank the Referee for his careful consideration, for the inconsistencies pointed out, and for the suggestions of improvement.
