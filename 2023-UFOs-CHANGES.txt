Changes of title and as suggested by Angela and the Editors:

*) On page 87 ff you discuss the US authorities’ strategy regarding UFOs and as the second point, you speculate that they engage in:

"Acceptance, exploitation, and sequestration of crashed UFOs and their inhabitants by a small group of insiders with connections to think tanks and military-industrial complexes."

This seems equivalent to an assertion that you accept the existence of UFOs with inhabitants. Perhaps it can be toned down to suggestion only that the organizations involved have instructions to follow up on any incidents in this manner (leaving open whether or not they actually occur).

**) Changed to:

It cannot be outrightly excluded that there may be an ongoing exploitation and sequestration of crashed UFOs, though this remains to be corroborated by factual evidence. It is possible that a select few insiders, with ties to influential think tanks and military-industrial complexes, may have access to crashed UFOs and their occupants.
Battelle Memorial Institute, a private nonprofit company that specializes in technology development, is one example of a think tank that some individuals suspect may have ties to this area. Another possible connection could be Lockheed Martin Corporation. Furthermore, there are those who speculate that private contractors may be more integral to the government's activities in this field due to governmental transparency and oversight laws such as the Freedom of Information Act, as well as occasional presidential or congressional reviews.

*) p 113 ff you give the accounts by Horsley about his (imagined) exchanges with a being called Janus. From the way you report this, one is almost inclined to think that you find the story credible, rather than assuming that Horsley was making this up for his own gain or suffering from hallucinations. In the interest of remaining neutral/objective in such questions, it might be better to report the story in slightly abbreviated form and to present it as an example of how rumors arise and how public interest and the press together enable wild speculation to gain credence among a wide audience.


**)  Changed to:

Horsley recounts a meeting with someone who was said to be named ``Janus'' who seemed knowledgeable about the history and agenda of extraterrestrial visitors.
Janus believed that Earth was a small part of the universe and that extraterrestrial traffic to Earth was minimal.
These extraterrestrials had developed means of superluminal travel.

Despite Earth allegedly being a galactic backwater inhabited by only semi-civilized and dangerous humans,
explorers still wished to find out more about it, much like people on Earth who travelled to uncomfortable and dangerous places.
Therefore, interference with life on Earth was kept to a minimum.
Some extraterrestrial vehicles were manned by beings with advanced mental powers who made contact with select individuals.
These beings did not use weapons and were equipped with medical technology to operate on Earth.
Horsley suspected that Janus might be part of a plot, but when he tried to contact him again, Janus and his contacts had disappeared.


*) p. 128 ff. Here you discuss experiences of abduction or close encounters with aliens. From the way it is presented, the reader clearly gets the impression that you believe that a small proportion of such reports could be associated with real abductions and real encounters with aliens. It would be better not to indicate any kind of belief, but to suggest a way of dealing with the reports that will help to eliminate many of them for the kind of reasons you mention.  Those that remain would then be the ones deserving of further study. But still without any presupposition of their truth.  (For sure many such reports are simple fabrications, people seeking to exploit the public interest for their own gain.)


**)  Changed to:

Estimating the percentage of individuals who have encountered a ``hard case'' UFO/UAP sighting---one that cannot be easily dismissed due to ordinary phenomena or causes---is a complex task.
On one hand, numerous sightings go unreported due to various factors such as:
\begin{itemize} \item Neglect or disinterest \item Fear of ridicule \end{itemize}
On the other hand, a significant portion of these reports may be mere fabrications, created by individuals who:
\begin{itemize} \item Seek to exploit public interest for personal gain \item Desire to feel extraordinary and find meaning in their otherwise mundane lives \end{itemize}
Consequently, distinguishing between credible sightings and hoaxes or misidentifications proves to be challenging.

Furthermore, it is still unclear what percentage of individuals, also known as experiencers, have had a profound encounter,
which is typically accompanied by an ``ontological shock'' as discussed in Section~\ref{2023-UFO-part-Perception-abductions-Ontologicalshock}.
Such an encounter goes beyond a simple sighting that may have little impact on the individual.

A third category of deep experiencers consists of the so-called abductees, individuals who claim to have been abducted by extraterrestrials.
The number of people identifying as abductees remains uncertain.
Although differentiating between alleged abductees and alleged experiencers may appear challenging, Jacobs~\cite{Jacobs2015Oct}
posits that an individual is typically either one or the other, with few cases falling in-between.
A 1992 estimate~\cite{HJW1992,Donderi2013Mar} suggests that approximately 2{\%}
of Americans may have experienced the UFO Abduction Syndrome.
Don Crosbie Donderi\index{Donderi, Don Crosbie} asserts that he can use a questionnaire to determine with a high degree of accuracy
whether a person has been abducted~\cite{Donderi2013Jun}.

Allow me to clarify that I have not had any such experiences myself, and I do not intend to engage in debates regarding the factuality of these experiences or abductions~\cite{Sagan1997Feb}.
My stance is that many individuals who claim to have had an experience and cannot be easily dismissed as profiteers or hoaxers
likely have a genuine experience that should be treated seriously in an epistemic manner, though not necessarily in an ontic sense. In other words, this discussion focuses on experiences rather than facts.
While factuality is important, it remains uncertain and highly questionable.

*) p. 132 Fort’s hypothesis is surely wild speculation based on no evidence at all. To justify the inclusion of such material, it would be good to say a few words about including it for the sake of completeness. And/or relating it to the apparent human need/capacity for inventing stories and coming up with explanations, however wild these may be!


**)  Added the following paragraphs:

Fort's hypothesis can undoubtedly be considered as wild speculation with seemingly no substantial empirical evidence.
I suppose many critical readers might blame me for even bringing it up.
However, it may still be worthwhile to include this material for the sake of historic completeness.
Additionally, discussing this hypothesis can shed light on the innate human tendency to phantasize and invent stories and devise explanations,
regardless of how far-fetched they may appear.

On the other hand, some individuals may argue that Fort's ideas have not been conclusively disproven, and that their personal experiences lend support to at least some of his speculations.
However, we need to recall Carl Sagan's critical stance on any appeal to ignorance---the claim that
``whatever has not been proved false must be true''~\cite{Sagan1997Feb},
and that ``extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence''~\cite{Laplace1814,Flournoy1900,Russell1952}.

In Fort's line of speculation, ...


*) p. 136 Here you give your  own position, which indeed also acknowledges people’s need to associate beliefs with the things they subjectively experience. I think this if fine, but it is important in the book to separate the psychological from the scientific.

The following passage

"Many experiencers seem to be very much afraid---almost ashamed---to talk about their experiences. This hesitancy might also be due in part to the attempt to self-repress such experiences, as a way to cope with the ontological shock that comes with them. Because if they told these stories aloud and ``to the world,'' this would document their own (maybe involuntary) ``difference,'' or even ``strangeness.''

Therefore, we need to create friendly spaces and environments so that nobody should be afraid to recount their extraordinary and sometimes very strange and very private stories."

is not really relevant to the business of finding out whether UFOs/aliens actually exist. Except in people’s minds. I think it is fine to include some discussion on this point, but again it needs to be clear to the reader that you are not interpreting the reports as anything more than a subjective experience that may well be an illusion.


**)  Changed to/rewritten as:

I am convinced that we need to be aware that not all experiencers are hoaxers or profiteers, and that what some experiencers share is at least authentic, mind-boggling, and subjectively true. However, this kind of openness and suspended attention should not, under any circumstances, lead researchers to unquestioningly accept the factuality of these narratives and memories.

Likewise, experiencers need to be aware that their memories and experiences may not be entirely factual. These mental contents can be interpreted in various ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item They might be (partly) imagined and fantasized,
\item some profound trauma may have been translated or transferred by the mind to an alien context,
\item or they might not be imagined at all, but have actually occurred to that person in some form.
\end{itemize}

In any case, it is crucial to strive for a rigorous and empirical approach when investigating anomalous experiences. One effective way to do this is to augment, falsify, or corroborate such experiences with physical sensors, such as infrared, radar, or visual sensors. By doing so, we can attempt to establish a correlation between these objective measurements and the subjective experiences reported by individuals.

However, simply not believing, laughing at, or distrusting genuine subjective experiences by experiencers is,
in my opinion, an inadequate response. Many experiencers seem to be very much afraid---almost ashamed---to talk about their experiences.
This hesitancy might also be due in part to the attempt to self-repress such experiences, as a way to cope with the ontological shock that comes with them.
Because if they told these stories aloud and to the world, this would document their own (maybe involuntary) difference, or even strangeness,
which might be a challenge both to them but also to their peers and the religious or secular societies they are living in.

Therefore, I propose creating both friendly spaces and environments so that nobody should be afraid to recount their extraordinary, sometimes very strange, and highly personal stories. Additionally, maintaining a critical scientific attitude that offers clinical psychological help and interdisciplinary research into these matters is essential.

On May 17, 1879, almost exactly one year earlier,
Commander John Eliot Pringle, Capain on the H.M.S. Vulture,  recorded an almost identical encounter~\cite{Pringle1879}:
\begin{svgraybox}
``I noticed luminous waves or pulsations in the water, moving at great speed and passing under the ship from the south-south-west. On looking towards the east, the appearance was that of a revolving wheel with centre on that bearing, and whose spokes were illuminated, and looking towards the west a similar wheel appeared to be revolving, but in the opposite direction. I then went to the mizen top (fifty feet above water) with the first lieutenant, and saw that the luminous waves or pulsations were really travelling parallel to each other, and that their apparently rotatory motion, as seen from the deck, was caused by their high speed and the greater angular motion of the nearer than the more remote part of the waves. The light of these waves looked homogeneous, and lighter, but not so sparkling, as phosphorescent appearances at sea usually are, and extended from the surface well under water; they lit up the white bottoms of the quarter-boats in passing. I judged them to be twenty-five feet broad, with dark intervals of about seventy-five between each, or 100 from crest to crest, and their period was seventy-four to seventy-five per minute, giving a speed roughly of eighty-four English miles an hour.

From this height of fifty feet, looking with or against their direction, I could only distinguish six or seven waves; but, looking along them as they passed under the ship, the luminosity showed much further.

The phenomenon was beautiful and striking, commencing at about 6h. 3m. Greenwich mean time, and lasting some thirty-five minutes.''

*) Changed and added the following paragraph and references to \section{Rendlesham Forest incident in 1980}\label{2023-UFO-chapter-History--1953-2016-rf1980}:

This incident involves the alleged visitation of alien craft near or at the twin bases of
Royal Air Force (RAF) [[station]] Bentwaters/Woodbridge and Royal Air Force (RAF) [[station]] Bentwaters.
RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge were two air bases leased by Britain's Royal Air Force to the US Air Force.
Rendlesham Forest was situated between them, and the bases were approximately 72km apart.
Rumors circulated that one of the biggest stockpiles of US-controlled nuclear weapons in Europe was stored at RAF Bentwaters.
Allegedly, ``nuclear weapons stored in the Weapons Storage Area at RAF Woodbridge were struck by light beams
fired from an unidentified craft seen over the base in the period 25--30 December 1980''~\cite{Hill-Norton1997}.

Unconfirmed accounts leaning toward flying saucers of some type has been presented in several books~\cite{Bruni2000Nov,Pope2014Apr,Heseltine2023Feb}
by Georgina Bruni, Nick Pope, John Burroughs, and James (Jim) W. Penniston and Gary Heseltine.

\subsection{UFO scanning a weapons storage area in late December 1980}

Sergeant Steve Longero of the USAF Security Police
allegedly saw an object hovering over the treetops outside the perimeter of the Bentwaters (nuclear) Weapon Storage Area~\cite{Heseltine2023Feb,FleischerHeseltine2023April},
with  different colored lights on it,
disc-shaped, and with a greenish glow. He estimated that it was about 200 to 300 yards away, at an approximate altitude of perhaps 40 to 50 feet,
 and was located on the forest side of the nuclear Weapon Storage Area.
He described the object as looking like an eye with something dripping off it, and he observed a searchlight-like beam coming from the object
and shining onto the ground within the Weapon Storage Area.
The beam was continually moving and shining across the entire area in a grid search pattern,
scanning the entire row of bunkers with nuclear weapons, casting left to right.
The object then moved away over the forest out of view, and Longero began to hear a lot of radio chatter.


\subsection{A reddish/orange object on late December 27, 1980}

According to a recent reinvestigation of the Rendlesham Forest Incident by a formal criminal investigator Gary Heseltine~\cite{Heseltine2023Feb},
Lt. Bonnie Tamplin's traumatic incident during late December 1980 has long been established, but only fragments of the incident were previously known.
According to the generally accepted story before the Heseltine's reinvestigation,
Two USAF Security police officers, Airwoman Lori Buoen and Airman John Trementozzi, saw a red ball of fire descend into the forest while at the East Gate.
Lt Tamplin, who happened to be on mobile patrol in the area,
agreed to investigate and soon after, Buoen and Trementozzi heard Tamplin's distressed screaming voice over the radio requesting help.
Master Sergeant ``Bobby'' Ball was believed to have responded to her cries over the radio first and reached her first.
Tamplin was so traumatized that she was relieved from duty and seemingly did not return to shift duty.

However, during the filming of Capel Green, former Airman First Class Michael Stacy Smith came forward with direct witness testimony to the events involving Lt Tamplin.
Although he cannot tell the whole story as a direct witness,
a trusted supervisor on shift had told him the rest of the story.
According to Smith, Lt Tamplin had visited him on the night of the incident and told him she was going to Woodbridge.
A few minutes later, he heard her voice over the radio, but it wasn't clear.
He saw several vehicles leaving Central Security Control in a hurry and was told to go to Butley Gate.

A short time later, MSgt Ball returned in his vehicle with Lt Tamplin, who was crying, had dirty clothes, and was not wearing her beret.
Smith learned from a supervisor after the shift that an orange/reddish ball had come in front of Tamplin's jeep as she was driving.
Apparently, in trying to get away from the object, the jeep ran off the road and rolled onto its side. Lt.
Tamplin was able to crawl out of it but the reddish/orange object was still close to her location, so she had opened fire on it.
After this incident, when her weapon was checked into the armory after the incident, a number of rounds were found to be missing.
The missing rounds were replaced after the weapon was cleaned and returned to the armory.
Heseltine mentioned that so far had Tamplin refused to come forward and tell her story~\cite{FleischerHeseltine2023April}.

He describes being taken to a field known as the ``farmer's field'' with a group of other guards.
In the field, they saw approximately 15 to 20 US Airforce security officers standing in a circle around a yellowish-green fog that
was hugging the ground and glowing. Suddenly, a small light, the size of a beach ball, self-illuminated, and not quite red in color,
appeared and stopped over the mist. There was then a bright explosion of light that left a shimmering,
translucent craft on the ground where the mist had been.
Warren claims that the incident was being filmed by two people from a distance using early video and cine film cameras.
Warren says that he witnessed something akin to a bubble emerging from the craft and dividing into three bubbles, each containing the upper torso of a humanoid figure.
The three entities floated beside the craft, and Warren claims that he saw Colonel Williams have a silent face-off with them.
 Eventually, Warren was told to leave and return to the staging area,
where vehicles were parked and could go no further into the forest~\cite{Heseltine2023Feb,FleischerHeseltine2023April}.


*) Changed and added the following paragraph and references to \subsection{USS Princeton observes groups of objects raining out of the sky toward the sea}:

The USS Princeton, part of a strike group,
had been tracking strange groups of objects for several days---from November 4 to November 14 over a 10 day period,
it was probably 100 different contacts in groups of five to ten, at a time seemingly randomly~\cite{WestDayKevin2021Feb}.
Ballistic missile defense had observed objects beyond the upper atmosphere.
These groups of five to ten   emerged    at an altitude of 80\,000 feet.
The group of objects would then rapidly descend toward the ocean and end at 35\,000 to 20\,000 feet close to Catalina Island,
where they would hover almost stationary or move southbound towards Guadalupe Island which is approximately 500 kilometres (300 miles) away.
They kept a tight formation in the same relative positions to each other the entire time
at a speed of approximately 100 knots or 200 km/hour.
Afterwards, they would either shoot straight back upward~\cite{Cooper2017Dec} or drop down to the ocean
at incredible speeds of approximately 24\,000 miles/hour or 40\,000 km/hour
before vanishing from the radar close to Guadalupe Island~\cite{WestDayKevin2021Feb}.

At some point, when the objects appeared on radar,
Gary Voorhis, a system technician in the USS Princeton,
went up to the bridge to observe them through the ship's ``Big Eyes,''
which were heavily magnified binoculars~\cite{PMWitnesses2021Mar}.
The objects were too far away to discern any specific details, but Voorhis could clearly see something whitish moving unpredictably in the distance.
recalls that during nights the objects had a uniform phosphorescent glow~\cite{WestVoorhis2020Jan}.
They could be seen more easily in the dark than in the daylight.

changed Hawkeye -> E-2 Hawkeye (multiple times)

Four people in total, including the two pilots Fravor and Dietrich, as well as their respective weapons systems officers,
observed a smaller object for approximately five minutes. Fravor reported that as he spiraled down to get closer to the object,
it suddenly seemed to recognize his plane. The object turned toward him and started to mirror his movements; as he went down,
the object was coming up. Fravor's plane and the object circled around each other, but while the object was ascending, Fravor's plane was descending.

In Day's alternative recollection~\cite{WestDayKevin2021Feb} of the engagement Fravor told him that, as Fravor's plane
approached the formation of five objects, the lead object of the formation did  a barrel roll around him,
and headed straight down to the water. Fravor followed and chased it down towards the ocean floor.

\subsection{Analysis of the flir, gofast and gimbal videos}

In what follows are Mick West's (and the group at Metabunk) critical analyses.
These in turn have been met with criticisms from other UFO investigators on two grounds~\cite{WestElizondo2021Mar}:
(i) Firstly, in line with a strategy employed by the late Edward Teller
(an experience I had the privilege of personally witnessing~\cite{Etim1992Aug}),
whenever one tried to ``nail Teller down'' with some argument,
he would take evasive action by stating that he could not disclose certain information due to national security concerns,
even though he was privy to classified information that supported his positions.
(ii) Secondly, similar to the first reason, there is an insinuation that anyone criticizing the ``strangeness'' of these videos
lacks knowledge of important contextual factors,
such as additional sensor data, better and longer videos,
and the opinions of highly competent experts who have already analyzed these videos and excluded prosaic explanations.


\subsubsection{Flir video}

As mentioned earlier, one---the ``FLIR'' video---of
three videos~\cite{NAVAIRFOIAFLIR2020Apr,NAVAIRFOIAGOFAST2020Apr,NAVAIRFOIAGIMBAL2020Apr}
that have been authenticated by the Department of Defense on April 27, 2020~\cite{DOD2020} is related to the previous narrative.
It was taken from a different airplane after Fravor's encounter with a ``tic-tac'' shaped UAP.

A detailed analysis~\cite{West2022Nov,WestFlir2020May,WestFravorWest2020Sep} by the ``debunker'' Mick West~\cite{Metabunk2023Mar}  \index{West, Mick}
attempted to demonstrate that the flir video actually shows an ordinary aircraft moving with constant velocity.
The video is overlaid with a time code and relevant information from the display to
show that all apparent movements are consistent with the object moving in a straight line to the left.
The camera was tracking the object visually, and every time there occurred a physical lens change or a camera rotation,
the lock was briefly lost, causing the object to appear as if it had suddenly changing speed.
The analysis suggests that the object was a distant aircraft flying along normally.

\subsubsection{Mirroring movement}

West also speculates that Fravor might have mistaken~\cite{WestFravorWest2020Sep,WestAlexDietrich2021Jun} the ``mirroring'' movement of an object that in reality remained almost
static in the center of the circle he was flying:
Fravor thought that he was  flying in a circle with some object mirroring him on the other side,
but in reality this might have been an illusion caused by some object that really was in the middle (rather than on the opposite end) of the circle.
When Fravor decided to cut across the circle, he saw something coming towards him unexpectedly fast and zipping by,
which realy was a loss of situational awareness from a misrepresentation of the airplane-object configuration.

\subsubsection{Gofast video}

West argues~\cite{West2022Nov,West2019Jun} that the object in the ``GOFAST'' video~\cite{NAVAIRFOIAGOFAST2020Apr}
is not actually flying low and fast over the water as it appears, but rather is flying high and slow.
He uses information from the video, such as the altitude of the jet, calibrated airspeed,
and distance to the target, to calculate the height and speed of the object.

West suggests that the object is actually around 13,000 feet above the water and traveling at a speed of 20 to 40 knots,
which is consistent with wind speed at that altitude. He also estimates that the object is about 6 to 7 feet in size,
which is similar to the size of a weather balloon.
This assumption would explain why it appears cold on the infrared camera.

\subsubsection{Gimbal video}

The Metabunk team including West argue~\cite{markus2022Sep,West2022Nov,West2022Mar,WestFravorWest2020Sep} that the object in the ``GIMBAL'' video~\cite{NAVAIRFOIAGIMBAL2020Apr}
likely shows a glare~\cite{Talvala_2007} that hides the actual object, and that the shape of this glare only appears to be rotating because
the camera mounted on a gimbal rotates, and in order to de-rotate the horizon, any glare---which does not rotate relative to camera like the horizon does---appears to rotate.
Therefore, the rotation of the UAP axes appears to be an illusion, created by the visual system of the aircraft.

In more detail, the rotation of the object is an artifact originating from the optical and post-processing system used:
The camera, which is mounted on a two-axis gimble system, can only rotate along two axes (roll and pitch) when actually three axes of rotation would
be needed to ``faithfully'' track an object.
In order to keep the horizon at constant (zero, horizontal) angle, a post-processing step called ``de-ro'' short for ``de-rotation'' is applied to the video:
the de-ro device (or algorithm) takes the entire image and rotates it to obtain an unchanging horizon.

However, at the same time, the orientation of the glare from some thermal radiation (possibly from a jet plane) remains fixed relative to the camera (sensor) frame~\cite[time = 632~s]{West2022Mar}:
as the ``glare orientation is [[fixed]] relative to the camera [[sensor frame]] --- rotate the camera and
the background will rotate but the glare angle will remain unchanged [[relative to the camera sensor frame]].''
The reason for this is that glare is an artifact of the camera's optics.  Therefore, under camera rotations, the glare remains
invariant with respect to the frame due to the co-varying nature of the optics/(sensor) frame system.


Moreover, if the de-rotation is applied through post-processing to obtain a nonvarying horizon orientation,
and as the relative angle of the horizon and the camera glare/(sensor) frame system changes (due to camera rotation), the glare's angle relative to the horizon changes.
In summary, the alleged rotation of the object in the ``GIMBAL'' video is an illusory artifact of the camera/post-processing system used to track the object.

Turner's analysis of 1971 continues with what he calls ``astounding'' investments made by the US into anti-gravity research.
During the early years of his career, in 1956, Turner came across the US anti-gravity project through a note that was posted on a board at Harwell,
which was Britain's inaugural Atomic Energy Research Establishment, according to some biographical notes by   Dominic McNamara and Bill Chalker~\cite{Turner-bio-Chalker}:

Indeed, the authenticity of this narrative has allegedly been denied by Admiral Thomas Ray Wilson:
Wilson himself called the notes ``fiction'' and stated, ``I wouldn't know Eric Davis if he walked in right now''~\cite{cox20,Cox2021Aug}.

\section{Could we hack ourselves in their database?}
\label{2023-UFO-part-Perception-crash-retreivals-hack}


An additional option to the aforementioned ``alien Prometheus'' explaining their technology to us personally may be to locate their ``computer,''
that is, the information storage and handling facility, in a recovered craft.
Most likely, this will be guarded and provided by an advanced form of artificial intelligence.

If we were able to access and penetrate it, we might be able to recover
its information content---a sort of encyclopedia galactica---which would also include their means of propulsion and energy source.
But this maybe hopeless: their technology might be so advanced that our own computers would seem like mere abacuses in comparison.
Attempting to hack into their systems would be like trying to operate our own computers with an abacus---an
endeavor that would highlight the vast technological gulf between our civilizations.

A first attack on such a database would be to identify its hardware. Suppose for a moment we had retrieved a (partially) intact flying saucer from a crash.
How should we go about in identifying potential storage facilities in such a craft?
I suggest that, as any such storage can be assumed to be ``very advanced'' its material layer can be expected to be ``very complex''---that is, the information density stored per ``stuff'' is high.
That in turn means that such a memory device, if analyzed on an atomic level, should appear to be highly irregular, randomly aligned, akin to white noise.
There is almost paradoxical feature of highly organized, dense coding: the ciphertext appears random in the
very precise sense of algorithmic information theory (with randomness roughly meaning algorithmic incompressibility.
So, one criterium to identify storage on such a recovered craft would be that it appears disorganized and ``amorphous.''


To identify potential storage facilities in a recovered flying saucer, we must first determine its hardware.
Given that any such storage is likely to be highly advanced, we can assume that its material layer is also highly complex.
This means that the information density stored per unit of material is high, and any memory device would appear irregular and randomly aligned at an atomic level,
similar to white noise.

However, this paradoxical feature of highly organized, dense coding also means that the ciphertext appears random in the very precise sense
of algorithmic information theory~\cite{calude:02}). Informally speaking, it would be algorithmically incompressible, making it difficult to identify
using conventional methods.

Therefore, a key criterion to identify storage on a recovered craft would be its disorganized and ``amorphous'' appearance.
By looking for areas of the craft that appear structurally irregular and chaotic, we may be able to locate potential storage devices.
Additionally, we could use advanced scanning techniques to analyze the material at an atomic level and identify any areas of high information density.
Overall, a multi-faceted approach
that combines structure analysis of the material with algortithmic pattern analysis
would be necessary to successfully identify and cryptanalize storage facilities in a recovered flying saucer.

One argument against conventional search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is that any signals emitted by a civilization that are identifiable through conventional analysis might only be detectable for a relatively short period, perhaps just one or two centuries. This is due to the fact that as technology progresses and broadcasts become digitized, the emitted signals tend to approach white noise, making them much more difficult to analyze and decipher. Therefore, traditional SETI approaches that rely solely on detecting narrowband radio signals may
not be effective in detecting advanced civilizations that have moved beyond using this type of technology.

\section{The overall context}

I encourage the reader to step out of the contemporary timeframe and consider this universe in a more holistic context as a container for evolving consciousness,
and life in very general terms.
In that perspective it is almost certain that some form of sentient life form has developed long before us,
and will develop long after our current civilization has faltered~\cite[Chapter~1]{schopenhauer-dwawuv-VII,Nietzsche-WahrheitLuege}.
The apparent lapse of time acts like a malstream, swallowing up the worlds.
All civilizations, alien and earthbound, seem to be subject to these very same conditions.

\section{Uniform recommendation of government UFO panels: continue qualified research}

All government panels I am aware of recommended the initiation or continuation of some
(though modest size) academic efforts of research into unidentified phenomena of the UFO sort.
Let me quote from three of them.

The Durant Report~\cite{RobertsonPanelDurantReport}, subsuming the recommendations of the 1952-53 Robertson Panel,
emphasized that UFO's (aka ``Flying Saucers''),  ``shows no indication that these phenomena constitute a direct physical threat to national security''
but stated
\begin{svgraybox}
``Dr. Robertson at least was of the opinion that [[$\ldots$]] there would still be a role for a [[$\ldots$]] section
to cope with the residuum of items of possible scientific intelligence value.
This section should concentrate on energetically following up [[$\ldots$]]
those cases which seemed to indicate the evidence of unconventional enemy artifacts.''
\end{svgraybox}




In  ``Section I: Conclusions and Recommendations'' of the Condon Report~\cite{Condon-report,Condon-report-Bantam,Condon-report-Dutton,BibEntry2023Jan} of 1968,
Edward U. Condon writes
\begin{svgraybox}
``Scientists are no respecters of authority. Our conclusion that study of UFO reports is not likely to advance science will not be
uncritically accepted by them. Nor should it be, nor do we wish it to be. For scientists, it is our hope that the detailed analytical
presentation of what we were able to do, and of what we were unable to do, will assist them in deciding whether or not they agree with
our conclusions. Our hope is that the details of this report will help other scientists in seeing what the problems are and the difficulties
of coping with them.

If they agree with our conclusions, they will turn their valuable attention and talents elsewhere. If they disagree it will be because
our report has helped them reach a clear picture of wherein existing studies are faulty or incomplete and thereby will have stimulated
ideas for more accurate studies. If they do get such ideas and can formulate them clearly, we have no doubt that support will be
forthcoming to carry on with such clearly-defined, specific studies. We think that such ideas for work should be supported.''
\end{svgraybox}


In the ``Subsidiary Recommendations'' section of the ``Executive Summary'' of the UK Condign Report~\cite{CondignReport} of 1996,
Ron Haddow, its alleged author~\cite{Clarke2022Nov}, writes
\begin{svgraybox}
``The relevance of plasma and magnetic fields to UAP were an unexpected feature of
the study. It is recommended that further investigation should be into the
applicability of various characteristics of plasmas in novel military applications.''
\end{svgraybox}

This summary also notes that
\begin{svgraybox}
``Attempts by other nations to intercept the unexplained objects, which can
clearly change position faster than an aircraft, have reportedly already caused
fatalities  [[$\ldots$]]''

 ``The conditions for the initial formation and sustaining of what are apparently
buoyant charged masses, which can form, separate, merge, hover, climb, dive and
accelerate are not completely understood. Nevertheless, the underlying physics may
have some military application in the future in the form of active visual, radar and IR
decoys and passive electromagnetic spectrum energy-absorbers.''
\end{svgraybox}

With regards to civil aviation, the following Recommendations hold:
\begin{svgraybox}
\begin{itemize}
\item[--] ``It should be stressed that, despite the recent increase in UAP events, the
probability of encountering a UAP remains very low.
\item[--]  No attempt should be made to out-manoeuvre a UAP during interception.
\item[--]  At higher altitudes, although UAP appear to be benign to civil air-traffic,
pilots should be advised not to manoeuvre, other than to place the object
astern, if possible.''
\end{itemize}
