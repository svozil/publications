"more in the pipeline"

Project Overview:

At first, the activity was directed towards the Work Packages #1 (A framework for understanding
irreversibility, indeterminism and randomness in physics) and #2 (Formal models describing
irreversibility, indeterminism and randomness in physics) with quantum randomness being the primary
focus. One of the main results obtained was 'a located' strong form of the Kochen-Specker Theorem
which allows the construction of a certified quantum random generator.

Alastair Abbott has been enrolled in a cotutelle PhD in UoA and ENS with C. Calude
and G. Longo as co-supervisors.

UoA student Jonathan Conder was attracted to work on the project and his contribution is
incorporated in a joint paper listed above.

In the following, quantum randomness being the primary focus, thereby again covering topics in
Work Packages #1  and #2. We worked towards developing models to classify the randomness of
infinite sequences of random events, and using these models to describe the randomness of
individual events. One of the main results obtained was 'a located' strong form of the
Kochen-Specker Theorem which, when coupled with our description of the output of a quantum random
number generator, allows the construction such a device certified by these results to produce
highly incomputable output.


We have then started research on Work Package #3 (Logical relations between irreversibility,
indeterminism and randomness in physics), studying in great formal detail the mechanisms allowing
the emergence of classical and quantum randomness, and their relations. So far we have mainly
considered quantum processes; but we have also discussed conceptualization of classical chaotic
systems.

As part of the formal methods developed for Work Package #2
we have developed a formal model of unpredictability which can be uniformly used
across classical and quantum domains. This tool is being used in Work Package #3
to help analyse the relations between various forms of unpredictability and randomness.

Some issues:

KS has been single paren; NZ school system does not treat children of IRSES participants
equivalently to, say, children of foreign PhD students or military personnel
(= HUGE tuition costs; higher than IRSES grant)

No travel allowance for EU member (allowance for NZ members);
let alone possibility to fly business class
(comparison to EU expert panel members)
