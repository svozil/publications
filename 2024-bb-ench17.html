Raes</h2>
<!-- l. 404 --><p class='noindent'>Immediately after his arrival, the Polynesians thought Paul
Gauguin was a <span class='ptmri7t-x-x-120'>Mahu</span>, a “mediator” or “woman-man”, because of
his long, flowing hair and his eccentric clothing style. Gauguin,
who at first did not know what to do with this and often associated
with young Polynesian women, allegedly had his hair cut
immediately.
</p><!-- l. 407 --><p class='indent'>   What strikes me immediately after my arrival, as I wait for the
ferry with other passengers: a masculine-looking lady! She is not
dressed particularly conspicuously, wearing a cotton dress with
bright floral patterns. I try not to stare at her or look at her. But just
as surely as my mind identified her as a “gentleman pretending to
be a lady”, she identified me just as quickly as someone
who is looking at her. Otherwise she would not stand out;
everyone else acts as if it were the most natural thing in the
world.
</p><!-- l. 409 --><p class='indent'>   Then in Huahine another “lady” boards the boat, this time
wearing a striking feather sash and an orange knitted dress
with no shoulder covering. She looks a little conspicuous
and seems to know everyone and is treated with respect and
kindness.
</p><!-- l. 411 --><p class='indent'>   The next day on the beach at Matira I see a somewhat
implausible “she” in a tight bikini, together with another
lady, both of them usually obese, and a small child—maybe
teirs.
</p><!-- l. 413 --><p class='indent'>   Then I see again in front of the church in Vaitape a “she like
                                                        
                                                        
that” in a colorful dress.
</p><!-- l. 415 --><p class='indent'>   In the 2022 film “Pacifiction,” Pahoa Mahagafanau plays a
trans woman named Shannah who is an ally of sorts to the French
High Commissioner.
</p><!-- l. 417 --><p class='indent'>   It takes some time for me to realize that these ladies here are
called <span class='ptmri7t-x-x-120'>Rae Raes </span>and are treated with great respect, like Mahus
who were honored or at least treated with respect in ancient
Polynesian culture.
</p><!-- l. 419 --><p class='indent'>   I wonder: What is the percentage of such inclinations or
determinations here?
</p><!-- l. 421 --><p class='indent'>   Assuming a frequency of five to ten percent of homosexual
orientation in the total population, then the transgender proportion
is reduced again by a factor of ten. I imagine that this is
traditionally practiced here, rather than suppressed like in Western
cultures.
</p><!-- l. 423 --><p class='indent'>   The existence and open display of transvestism also shows
how little Christian missionary activity has “taken effect” here in
the South Seas. Evil tongues claim that the gentle South Sea
chants that one seems to hear in Christian churches in Polynesia
are the only reason why the locals visit these churches: to come
together and sing. Or rather, as I observed at the Christmas mass in
Vaitape, to shout rather than sing.
</p><!-- l. 425 --><p class='indent'>   I am thinking of a documentary about the missionary who was
killed by the Sentinelese not so long ago. It features a former
missionary who lost his faith because of “his” indigenous people,
who asked him “plausible” questions about the origins of his
religion. Here the “primitive” appears as an “enlightener”. Maybe
these indigenous people also remain in a kind of limbo: because
contact with the Europeans also caused the disintegration of
                                                        
                                                        
their one faith. What remains are the eternal metaphysical
questions: why does something exist rather than not, and is there
anything that “survives” or “escapes” the disintegration of the
body?
