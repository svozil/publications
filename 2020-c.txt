ABSTRACT = {Classical evaluations of configurations of intertwined quantum contexts induce relations, such as true-implies-false and true-implies-true, but also nonseparability among the input and output terminals. When combined, these exploitable configurations (also known as gadgets) deliver the strongest form of classical value indefiniteness. However, the choice of the respective configuration among all such collections, and thus the relation of its terminals, remains arbitrary and cannot be motivated by some superselection principle inherent to quantum or classical physics.},
