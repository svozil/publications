Unlike the restrictive exchange of knowledge and technologies depicted in the ancient Greek legend of Prometheus,
the Babylonian tale portrays a more favorable and fortuitous series of events~\cite{Y_ld_r_m_2022}.
In the Babylonian narrative, the flow of knowledge and technologies
appears to be more open and benevolent.

Perhaps Turner's observations and suspicions were partly stimulated by the private initiative
of two wealthy eccentric businessmen -- Roger Babson and Agnew Bahnson.
They envisioned and privately financed research into the ``shielding of gravity''
or some form of anti-gravity~\cite{Kaiser_2018}.
Babson's Gravity Research Foundation, founded in 1948, sponsored annual ``Essays on Gravitation'' competitions.
The winners included researchers like Stephen Hawking, who later became well-known scientists.
Bahnson played an instrumental role in the founding years of the Institute of Field Physics, Inc.
at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in 1955~\cite{Rickles_2021},
which hosted the 1957 Chapel Hill Conference on
``The Role of Gravitation in Physics''~\cite{Rickles2011Feb}.

\section{A former intelligence officer turned whistleblower}
\label{2023-UFO-part-Perception-crash-retreivals-fiotw}


David Charles Grusch, a former high-level UFO/UAP analysis official,
has claimed that elements of the United States military, intelligence, and industrial base
are withholding core secrets regarding UFO/UAPs from the public~\cite{Kean2023Jun,Entin2023Jun,Shellenberger2023Jun}.
According to Grusch, this includes  retrieved intact and partially intact craft of non-human origin
as well as the remains of their deceased pilots.
Allegedly, other nations have similar programs, and there has been a secret cold war regarding access and exploitation
of these non-human artifacts for over eighty years.
One of the early purported crashed craft is
``Mussolini's UFO''  crashed or landed near Magenta in Lombardy in Italy on April 11th, 1933, which,
after a hint from the Vatican, was allegedly transferred to the US after World War II.

On May 25, 2022,
Grusch,
then a G-15 employee at the National Geospatial-lntelligence Agency (NGA)
serving
as that Agency's Senior Technical Advisor for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) analysis,
successfully~\cite{CompassRoseLegalGroupPLLC}
filed a  ``Disclosure of Urgent Concern(s), Complaint of Reprisal''~\cite{2022-Grush-Rose-complaint}
to the  Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG)
through the law firm Compass Rose Legal Group, by its senior partner Irvin Charles McCullough, III, Esq., a former ICIG himself.
The complaint states:
``He has direct knowledge that certain IC [[(Intelligence Community)]] elements have purposely and intentionally
withheld and/or concealed UAP-related classified information from the US Congress. He has direct
knowledge that this classified information has been withheld and/or concealed by the involved IC
elements to purposely and intentionally thwart legitimate Congressional oversight of the UAP
Program.''

The complaint to ICIG also mentioned a previous confidential complaint by Grusch in July 2021,
which provided UAP-related classified information to the Department of Defense Inspector General (DoD IG).
It stated that this earlier complaint had been disclosed to individuals and/or entities outside the DoD IG,
and Grusch has faced retaliation and reprisals related to it.


Therefore, ``consistent with 50 U.S.C \S 3033(k)(5(D)(ii)(I), Mr. Grusch now wishes to directly communicate
the classified specifics of his UAP-related Urgent Concern(s) to the
US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI)
and the
US House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI).
Accordingly, we hereby request that your office facilitares Mr. Grusch's direct communication with the SSCI and HPSCI.''

In July 2022, the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) found his complaint ``credible and urgent,''
and according to Grusch, a summary was distributed to the Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines,
as well as to both SSCI and HPSCI~\cite{Kean2023Jun}.
Therefore, it can be assumed that Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines,
and at least some members of both the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
and the US House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence have been briefed by Grusch and have knowledge of his UAP-related Urgent Concern(s).

So far, Grusch has not been allowed to share heretofore-related classified information with the public. His account~\cite{Grush_2023_OS_HOC} has been backed by other individuals and officials~\cite{Kean2023Jun,Shellenberger2023Jun}.
However, it can be assumed that his public account is consistent with the earlier discussed Wilson memo.

\subsubsection{Title 10 versus Title 50 of the United States Code}
\label{2023-UFO-part-Perception-crash-retreivals--t1v50}

Title 50 is the section of the United States Code that covers war and national defense,
including intelligence activities and covert action.
According to some sources, most USAPs are conducted under Title 50 authority,
as they involve sensitive intelligence operations that require a high degree of secrecy and plausible deniability.

However, some USAPs may also involve military operations or support under Title 10,
which is the section of the United States Code that covers armed forces.
Thus  informally,  Title 10  pertains to the Department of Defense  and military operations, whereas  Title 50  pertains
to intelligence agencies like the CIA, intelligence activities, and covert action~\cite{wall2011demystifying}.

It is plausible to suppose that the majority of UFO-related USAPs,
if indeed they exist, would fall under the Title 50 category. As highlighted by
\index{AARO}AARO's Sean Kirkpatrick~\cite[time = 2410~s]{Kirkpatrick2023Apr}, the current operations of this agency are conducted under Title 10.
However, incorporating Title 50 authority could significantly expand its scope of legitimate inquiry.

On p. 281, at the end of Section A.4 and before section A.5 please insert the following paragraphs:

Just as the Department of Defense (DOD) has its Special Access Program (SAP),
the United States intelligence community has a corresponding system known as Controlled Access Program (CAP)~\cite{ICD906,CRSCAP22}. CAPs operate as compartmentalized control systems within specific levels of classification, which involve compartments and sub-compartments.

These levels of classification include TOP SECRET, SECRET, and CONFIDENTIAL, signifying the relative sensitivity of intelligence activities, sources, and methods described within a document, as well as the potential damage to United States national security that could result from unauthorized disclosure.

Within the intelligence community (IC), CAPs are most commonly found as compartments or sub-compartments within the TOP SECRET level of classified intelligence.

Similarly to DOD's USAPs, as outlined in the Intelligence Community Directive 906~\cite{ICD906},
Unacknowledged Controlled Access Programs (UCAPs) are those CAPs
with protective controls that ensure the existence of the program is not acknowledged,
affirmed, or made known to any person not authorized for such information.
They are different from acknowledged CAPs,
which are CAPs whose existence is known or can be made known to individuals who
do not have a need to know.

According to the Department of Energy (DOE) website~\cite{DOEHFMSP22}, the DOE Special Access Program (SAP)
is a program established for a specific class of classified information that imposes
safeguarding and access requirements exceeding those normally required for information at the same classification level.
The DOE SAP is administered by the Executive Secretary of the Special Access Program Oversight Committee (SAPOC),
which conducts its activities in accordance with the requirements of DOE Order 471.5.
This directive is classified as ``Official Use Only (OUO)'' and can
only be accessed by people who have a legitimate need to know.
The DOE SAP is established under Executive Order 13526 or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
