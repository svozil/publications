<!-- l. 253 --><p class='noindent'>Thilo Sarrazin, during his tenure as Berlin’s finance senator,
allegedly tested with his wife whether and how one could survive
on social security benefits in Germany. Specifically, the two of
them devised a savings plan that they adhered to for some
time.
</p><!-- l. 255 --><p class='indent'>   I have undertaken something similar here in Bora Bora.
Friends in Auckland had warned me that eating in Bora Bora
would bankrupt me. Fortunately, that has not been the case.
</p><!-- l. 257 --><p class='indent'>   First, it is important to understand what is expensive and what
is not. For example, baguettes are cheaper here than in many other
places, as they are subsidized by the government. Consequently,
some of these baguettes, supposedly, even end up being fed to
livestock.
</p><!-- l. 259 --><p class='indent'>   What else can you eat besides a baguette? The answer is:
almost everything is expensive. But there are interesting
exceptions! For instance, I often pair baguette with olive oil and
tomatoes or avocados. Local tomatoes, in particular, are quite
costly, costing around 8 Euros per kilo—though I cannot quite
explain why. Perhaps it is because there is little alternative but to
buy from very few supermarkets, or maybe it is because
everyone grows their own tomatoes, leading to what I can only
describe as “tourist prices,” a phenomenon that was rumored
in Austria during the post-war period. I encountered the
same issue in New Zealand, where a small 400-gram bag of
tomatoes easily costs two and a half Euros. One has to wonder
whether there exists a price point beyond which everyone who
                                                        
                                                        
can will grow their own tomatoes, or consumption simply
collapses!
</p><!-- l. 265 --><p class='indent'>   However, if you go hiking—such as in Vaitape, where I was
bitten by a dog, or in the Valley of the Kings near Fa’anui—you
occasionally find avocados for free, without having to steal them.
You also come across giant grapefruits lying by the side of the
path, which help weigh down your backpack. Mango trees, laden
with fallen, sometimes burst, ripe mangoes, are everywhere. The
abundance is so overwhelming that, even though I often swim for
long periods and shower with soap every day, I wake up in the
morning to the smell of mangoes emanating from my skin, a
peculiar yet sweet scent of perspiration. I have also found papayas
and green bananas, which I place in the sun to ripen and turn
yellow.
</p><!-- l. 267 --><p class='indent'>   A liter of organic Spanish olive oil costs only was affordable
10 Euros at the U-Mart in Vaitape. I promptly grab a bottle. A
week later, when I check the shelf again, there is only one
left.
</p><!-- l. 269 --><p class='indent'>   Currently, I also have a stash of Tyrolean jams, packaged in small
cubes with one side of aluminum that you can easily tear open.
These little fruit delights from a much colder country somehow
made their way here—a testament to the Austrian-German
post-war export miracle!
</p><!-- l. 271 --><p class='indent'>   But how does one secure good, inexpensive protein here? The
insider tip is freshly caught tuna! There are two types: one, redder
and more flavorful, and the other, a whiter, more tender variety.
Both types of tuna fillets are sold whole, priced around 11 Euros
per kilo everywhere. I stumble upon the tuna after seeing two
elderly women in the center of Vaitape, standing in the blazing
                                                        
                                                        
heat with a refrigerated container in front of them, a sign reading
“tun”. I ask them if I could have a look at the goods; they
hesitantly show me a huge tuna fillet, well-wrapped in cling film.
They explained that this piece would cost 1,600 Pacific Francs
(around 14 Euros). After withdrawing cash from an ATM, I return
and buy the fish for 1,500 Pacific Francs, having misunderstood
the price earlier. Later, I see these fresh tuna fillets for sale in
supermarkets throughout the island. This solves my protein
dilemma here!
</p><!-- l. 276 --><p class='indent'>   Additionally, if you have a hot water kettle in your hotel (or
bring a portable immersion heater), you can easily make thin
noodles with just hot water. Tomato paste, which you can pour
over the noodles (perhaps with a little seasoning), is also
widely available. This reminds me of an elderly German man I
once met in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, following a rather
unpleasant episode of vomiting and diarrhea. He explained
to me that he only fed himself boiled noodles with tomato
sauce.
</p><!-- l. 278 --><p class='indent'>   Rice, however, is a more complicated issue. You can soak it for
an extended period, as the Iranians do with great skill. But for that,
you’ll need a gas stove and at least a small cooking pot. If you
bring your cooking utensils with you, butane gas cartridges (type
206) are readily available here, and they cost only a little more
than they would at home.
</p><!-- l. 280 --><p class='indent'>   So, I believe that even on a modest German welfare budget,
you could live fairly well on food here in Bora Bora—provided
you do not factor in accommodation and avoid booking into a
luxury hotel on a remote motu. The overnight rates at those resorts
are so high that food prices almost become irrelevant!
                                                        
                                                        
</p><!-- l. 282 --><p class='indent'>   To put it in perspective: A night in a luxury over-water
bungalow on the east side will soon cost as much as my three and
a half weeks spent in a bungalow on Matira Beach!
