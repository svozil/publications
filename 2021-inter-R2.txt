I have revised the manuscript according to the Referee's suggestions as follows:

"Last paragraph of first section (lines from 34 to 38), should be changed from 1st-singular to 1st-plural:
Line 34: We, therefore, present...
Line36: ... We hope that the following ..."

I changed all sentences accordingly.

"In second section, first formula (between lines 46 and 47) could be more appropriate and more readable. Maybe to not separate into two lines? Suggestion: Put the whole formula into one line.

Same suggestion about formula between lines 47 and 48."

I did this; all equations are now in a single line, improving readability.

"Figure 1. Personally, i dont like free-hand-drawing pictures. If possible, my suggestion is (not obligatory) that authors create this picture using computer."

"Figure 2. Same comment as with Figure 1.

Figure 3. Same comment as with Figure 1.

Figure 4. Same comment as with Figure 1."

I understand that cartoonish free-hand-drawing pictures might not be optimal. In this case, I would kindly suggest leaving those figures as they are, because this signifies the very general ideas and possibilities mentioned. I understand that this is a very subjective evaluation, and if necessary and required, would change the drawing style.

"At the end of second section, after line 73, I suggest that author adds at least one sentence and reference that deals with contemporary applications of fractals. For example:
There are many inovative, usefull and interesting applications of fractal theory today, especially in new materials and nanostructures, that can lead as to a new view of dimensionality, but in other direction - into the innerspace [Ref].


[Ref] V.V.Mitic, et al., Fractal frontiers in microelectronic ceramic materials, Ceramics International, 2019, 45, 7, B (2019), 9679-9685."

According to the Referee's suggestion, I have added the following paragraph:

Fractal theory has inspired and evolved into many innovative, useful and interesting applications, especially in new materials and nanostructures.
Such important developments can lead us to new views of, and physical means related to, dimensionality~\cite{Hill-2017,Mitic-2019}.

"5. section should be changed from 1st-singular to 1st-plural:
Line 126: Let us conclude this...
Line 133: Let us  again point...
Line 134: ...it is our convintion that, ..."

I changed all sentences accordingly.

"Line 136-138: Please, remove the last sentence ("I hope that ... interested in.") This sentence is more like to be part of some letter to editor, and not part of scientific paper."

I have removed this sentence.

"If author adds a new reference about fractals, then rest of the references should be renumbered."

References have been renumbered

"Congratulation to author for brave approach."

I very kindly thank the Referee for these encouraging words.
