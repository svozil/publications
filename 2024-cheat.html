<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The inherent intangibility of fiat currencies, such as the Euro,
presents opportunities for debasement and resource reallocation
strategies. This issue is exacerbated when nations with diverse economic
conditions and demands form a monetary union. Moreover, the advanced and
nuanced nature of these strategies surpasses traditional debasement and
counterfeiting methods typically seen in commodity and (bi)metallic coin
systems, such as those experienced by the Latin Monetary Union <span
class="citation"
data-cites="Willis1901 Einaudi2001Jul flandreau-2000 bussiere-2017"></span>,
or tactics like issuing duplicate securities with identical registration
numbers and codes.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will briefly examine each of the six
strategies identified, which could, at least in principle, be employed
by any National Central Bank (NCB) within the Eurosystem (and one even
from outside it). We shall not delve into detailed analysis, as there is
some overlap with existing literature that explores, for example, a
credit facility among the Eurosystem’s national central banks <span
class="citation"
data-cites="Sinn-Target2 Sinn2017Mar sinn-2020 blake-2023 perotti-2024 ojeda-2024"></span>,
or, from a legislative perspective, the need for a reliable framework of
operations <span class="citation" data-cites="ojeda-2022"></span>. These
strategies include: Inflating TARGET balances, exchanging fake
collaterals and then defaulting, diluting self-imposed rules such as
debt ceilings and collateral requirements, money printing through
Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA), acquisitions through Agreement on
Net Financial Assets (ANFA), and finally, the perpetual (re)issuing and
chaining of sovereign bonds as Eurosystem collateral.</p>
<h1 id="strategem-1-inflate-target-balances">Strategem 1: Inflate TARGET
balances</h1>
<p>To quote the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) own publication on
TARGET imbalances <span class="citation"
data-cites="EuropeanCentralBank2015Sep"></span>: <em>“TARGET balances
are the net claims and liabilities of the euro area [[National Central
Banks]] NCBs vis-à-vis the ECB which arise through cross-border payments
settled in central bank money of the respective national banking sectors
or the NCBs themselves and are executed via the common euro area payment
platform known as TARGET.</em></p>
<p><em>When a bank makes a payment to another bank via TARGET, the
current account of the payer’s bank at its NCB is debited and the
current account of the recipient bank at its NCB is credited. If both
banks hold their current accounts at the same NCB there is no net impact
on the aggregate account of banks at the NCB and there are no
implications for TARGET balances. However, in the case of cross-border
transactions, the NCB of the paying bank sees a reduction in that banks
account at the NCB, and the NCB of the recipient bank sees an increase
in the recipient bank’s account. Such positions are balanced by a TARGET
liability for the first NCB and a TARGET claim for the second NCB.
TARGET liabilities and claims also result from cross-border transactions
by NCBs themselves, such as the purchase or sale of securities held for
investment purposes. At the end of each day, such intra-Eurosystem
claims and liabilities are aggregated and netted out throughout the
Eurosystem. This leaves each NCB with a single net bilateral position
vis-à-vis the ECB, in the form of a positive or negative TARGET balance.
By design, all the TARGET balances (including the ECB’s balance) add up
to zero.”</em></p>
<p>Essentially, TARGET imbalances function as an automatic credit
facility among the Eurosystem’s national central banks (NCBs),
distinguished by the following features <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sinn-Target2 Sinn2017Mar sinn-2020 blake-2023 perotti-2024 ojeda-2024"></span>:
(i) no collateral requirements, (ii) zero interest rates, (iii) no need
for approval from any authority such as the ECB’s Governing Council or
the Executive Board, (iv) unlimited duration, unlike the US Federal
Reserve System’s Interdistrict Settlement Accounts, which require an
annual settlement through the transfer of primarily US Treasury
Securities, and previously Gold Certificates and Special Drawing Rights,
and (v) no caps or limit.</p>
<p>Currently, the consequences of a default by one of the participating
national banks on this credit facility are undefined. The ECB’s
statements do not address the possibility of default, instead implying
that imbalances are resolved through mutual, collectivized credit lines
among Eurosystem member countries. This means that, for example, if the
Banco de España were to default (partially) on this debt, the Bundesbank
or the entire Eurosystem would need to absorb the losses, with the
extent of the absorption (from all to none) unknown at present. It is
highly probable that significant political pressures will influence the
resolution of such a situation.</p>
<p>On request the Austrian ÖNB, one of the national banks of the
Eurosystem, issued the following statement (in German, translation by
deepl.com) <span class="citation"
data-cites="2024-09-12-OeNB-email"></span>: <em>“There is no list of
TARGET balances between individual countries. The ECB acts as the
central settlement centre for the central banks participating in TARGET;
at the end of the day, the resulting claims and liabilities between the
national central banks are netted out to form a claim on or liability to
the ECB.”</em> This was corroborated by a statement of the ECB <span
class="citation" data-cites="2024-09-18-EcB-email"></span>: <em>“Please
note that TARGET balances are computed automatically at the end of the
day in TARGET Services. Unfortunately, the data you are enquiring for,
i.e. the balance position of each National Central Bank (NCB) vis-à-vis
all other NCBs, is not available.”</em></p>
<p>We conclude that, at the end of each day, the TARGET balances are
‘collectivized’ or netted among all members of the Eurosystem, and no
official record exists to delineate and analyze them, such as a
skew-symmetric matrix with vanishing diagonal entries, showing the
balances of each individual NCB against every other NCB.</p>
<p>The current reporting procedure for TARGET balances has significant
implications for the potential collapse of the Eurosystem and the
subsequent debt settlement among its member states. The procedure is
inadequate and irreversible, as it does not permit the tracking of
individual balances between National Central Banks (NCBs). To illustrate
this, consider Austria’s ÖNB, which has a current negative TARGET
balance of approximately <span class="math inline">−65</span> billion
(outstanding) Euro <span class="citation"
data-cites="EuropeanCentralBank2023Jun"></span>. This balance could have
resulted from various (a continuity of) transactions, such as lending
100 billion to Italy and borrowing 165 billion from Germany, or
alternatively borrowing 30 billion from Italy, lending 100 billion to
Germany, and borrowing 135 billion from France. However, the current
system does not allow for the identification of these specific
transactions, and no official records are maintained.</p>
<p>Formally, the quantitative flows of inter-NCB Target balances can be
represented by a skew-symmetric matrix with zero diagonal elements,
where the entry <span
class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub></span> in
the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>th row and <span
class="math inline"><em>j</em></span>th column represents the respective
TARGET balance of the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>th NCB
with respect to the <span class="math inline"><em>j</em></span>th NCB:
<span class="math display">$$T =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp;T_{12}&amp; T_{13} &amp; \cdots &amp; T_{1n}  \\
-T_{12} &amp; 0&amp;T_{23} &amp; \cdots &amp; T_{2n}   \\
-T_{13} &amp; -T_{23} &amp; 0&amp; \cdots &amp; T_{3n} \\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\vdots\\
-T_{1n}&amp; -T_{2n}&amp; -T_{3n}&amp;\cdots &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
.$$</span> This representation excludes balances of the ECB and the
Extra Euro Area (outside of the EU), whose inclusion is straightforward.
There are currently 20 NCBs in the Eurosystem (excluding the ECB), so
<span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 20</span>. Including the ECB and
the Extra Euro Area would result in <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 21</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 22</span>, respectively. The number of
independent inter-NCB TARGET balances per day is <span
class="math inline">(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>n</em>)/2 = <em>n</em>(<em>n</em> − 1)/2</span>,
which equals 190 for <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 20</span>,
210 for <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 21</span>, and 231 for
<span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 22</span>.</p>
<p>The current TARGET reporting aggregates these balances into <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 20</span>, as it only captures the
<span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> aggregate sums <span
class="math display">$$T_i =
\sum_{j=1}^n T_{ij}$$</span> for the <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>th NCB (noting that <span
class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>i</em><em>i</em></sub> = 0</span>).
Evidently, since <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em>(<em>n</em> − 1)/2 &gt; <em>n</em></span>
for <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> &gt; 2</span>, this accounting
is irreversible for <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> &gt; 2</span>,
meaning it cannot be reconstructed for more than two NCBs.</p>
<h1 id="strategem-2-exchange-fake-collaterals-then-default">Strategem 2:
Exchange fake collaterals then default</h1>
<p>Here is a quote from a crisis management paper by the Financial
Stability Institute (FSI) of the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS) exposing this scheme <span class="citation"
data-cites="Baudino2020Mar"></span>: <em>“<span
class="math inline">…</span> banks issued bonds and exchanged them
between each other so that they could be pledged as collateral with the
central banks. This allowed them to break free from central bank funding
limits since they could issue such bonds (which became known as ‘love
letters’) at will.”</em></p>
<p>So the basic idea of this strategem is to create fake collateral,
such as ‘I Owe (Y)Us’ (IOUs). Subsequently default on these worthless
certificates. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Flannery2009 Hreinsson2009 Sibert10"></span>.</p>
<p>In a little bit more detail, Icelandic banks exchanged debt
securities, using each other’s debt as ‘love letter’ collateral for
central bank borrowing. The Eurosystem also accepted these, despite
questionable correlation risks. Between February and April 2008,
Icelandic banks borrowed Eur 2.5 billion from the Central Bank of
Luxembourg using love letters. The European Central Bank (ECB) expressed
concern, and an informal agreement was made to limit their use, but
loans increased to Eur 4.5 billion by June. By July, love letters were
prohibited, and lending fell to Eur 3.5 billion. In autumn 2008, five
counterparties defaulted, three of which were Icelandic bank
subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Finally, in March 2009, after a European Parliament member questioned
the ECB about these loans, the strategem was publicly exposed.</p>
<p>This strategem bears some resemblance to a scheme in which two large
European banks outside of the Eurosystem were allegedly involved. During
the 2008 financial crisis, these banks allegedly created capital through
a credit-share swap: They needed around £7 billion in new capital during
the crisis. To raise this capital, they used a method that involved
lending money to a sovereign wealth fund, who in turn agreed to buy
newly issued shares in the banks. Essentially, the banks allegedly lent
the sovereign wealth fund the money to invest back into them, inflating
their equity <span class="citation" data-cites="Werner2016Nov"></span>.
This transaction, while effective in raising capital—as it is unlawful
for a bank to lend itself money <span class="citation"
data-cites="Westbrook2017Jun"></span>—got unsuccessfully flagged by one
regulatory body.</p>
<h1
id="strategem-3-dilute-self-imposed-rules-such-as-debt-ceilings-and-collateral-requirements">Strategem 3:
Dilute Self-Imposed Rules Such As Debt Ceilings And Collateral
Requirements</h1>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has faced increasing scrutiny for
diluting its self-imposed rules, particularly regarding debt ceilings
and collateral requirements. These rules were initially designed to
ensure fiscal responsibility among member states and maintain financial
stability in the eurozone. However, as economic pressures have
mounted—especially during crises like the Eurozone debt crisis and the
COVID-19 pandemic—the ECB has relaxed these rules to provide more
flexibility to member states.</p>
<p>One key area of dilution is the debt-to-GDP ratio. Originally,
eurozone countries were expected to maintain a debt-to-GDP ratio below
60%, as stipulated by the Maastricht Treaty. However, many countries
have consistently exceeded this limit. Instead of enforcing strict
penalties, the ECB has allowed more leniency, fearing that rigid
adherence to these rules could exacerbate economic downturns and stifle
growth.</p>
<p>Additionally, the ECB has relaxed collateral requirements, allowing
banks to use riskier assets as collateral for loans. While this move
aims to ensure liquidity in the financial system, it also raises
questions about the quality of assets being accepted. This leniency has
been accompanied by the ECB’s practice of indirect monetization of
budget deficits, by buying government debt on secondary markets. Some
fear that by allowing questionable collateral, the ECB is taking on
excessive risk, which could lead to financial instability if these
assets fail to perform.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from an article published by The Brookings
Institution <span class="citation" data-cites="belz2020ecb"></span>:
<em>“The ECB now accepts as collateral an expanded set of non-marketable
assets—including government guaranteed loans, lower quality loans, and
small business loans—that are outside of the general framework. It also
granted waivers to Greek sovereign debt, which, because of its
non-investment grade status, was not previously considered eligible
collateral. ‘Fallen angel’ bonds, those that have recently lost their
investment-grade rating, are now accepted as collateral as well. In
addition, the ECB reduced haircuts, the amount of collateral required in
excess of the loan amount, for its lending programs. In effect, the ECB
decided that it is willing to temporarily increase its risk tolerance so
banks can access the ECB’s liquidity operations.”</em></p>
<p>At the moment, the central banks hold about one third of the
long-term sovereign bonds issued. This makes them vulnerable against all
sorts of attacks by speculators, and against the desires of the
political bodies in their respective countries. If the trend of
collectivizing risks and debt continues, this could, in principle, make
it necessary to refinance these central banks and the Eurosystem in
general <span class="citation" data-cites="sauer-2023"></span>.</p>
<h1
id="strategem-4-moneyprinting-through-emergency-liquidity-assistance-ela">Strategem 4:
Moneyprinting Through Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA)</h1>
<p>Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) loans are crisis loans built
into the Euro system from the start but published only in 2017 <span
class="citation" data-cites="EuropeanCentralBank2017Jun"></span>. A
national central bank can declare a financial emergency, for instance by
a bank or debt run. The national central banks can print unlimited money
to lend to commercial banks within its jurisdiction, based on its own
collateral rules, ‘rescue’, these banks, allegedly at the NCB’s own
risk. This could also be used to delay a bankruptcy, and may have other
negative side effects <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sinn2017Mar"></span>.</p>
<p>ELA is by no means a small resource: For instance, at the height of
Greece’s 2015 crisis, ELA borrowing by Greek banks reached 71% of the
country’s nominal GDP <span class="citation"
data-cites="gibson-2020"></span>.</p>
<p>The ECB Governing Council can block such loans with a two-thirds
majority vote. However, if at least one-third supports the loans, they
cannot be stopped. In 2013, over a third of the ECB Governing Council
members were from GIPSIC (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and
Cyprus) countries in need of cheap credit, making it impossible for
others to form a blocking coalition. Until Latvia’s entry in 2014, these
countries could theoretically secure unlimited central bank credit
without opposition.</p>
<h1
id="strategem-5-aquisitions-through-agreement-on-net-financial-assets-anfa">Strategem 5:
Aquisitions Through Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA)</h1>
<p>Daniel Hoffmann’s doctoral thesis <span class="citation"
data-cites="Hoffmann-2005 Hoffmann-2016"></span> at the TU Berlin
uncovered that national central banks had secretly created money to buy
assets, generating profits for their governments. This practice,
amounting to 650 billion Euro in ANFA credits in 2011, caused tensions
within the ECB council. A confidential agreement was made to limit the
activity, but Hoffmann’s work exposed it, leading to the eventual public
release of the details <span class="citation"
data-cites="EuropeanCentralBank2022ANFA EuropeanCentralBank2022Dec"></span>.</p>
<h1
id="strategem-6-perpetual-reissuing-and-chaining-of-sovereign-bonds-as-eurosystem-collateral">Strategem 6:
Perpetual (Re)Issuing and Chaining of Sovereign Bonds As Eurosystem
Collateral</h1>
<p>It is common practice among all sovereign states to chain an
unlimited number of sovereign bonds <span class="citation"
data-cites="ECBMemorandum2019Oct"></span>, and thereby to roll over more
and more debt without ever being able to pay it back. In this process,
the original principal is devalued by compounded inflation—an effect
welcomed by the (sovereign) deptors—while at the same time the required
amount of money created grows exponentially (by that compounding
inflation).</p>
<p>Instead of going into too much detail here I just recall the answer
of a prominent OECD researcher to my question <em>“will any government
ever pay back this sovereign debt, or are they at least committed to do
so?”</em> at a scientific meeting organized by the Austrian National
Bank (ÖNB): his answer was a staightforward <em>“no”</em>, after he
checked that I am not a journalist. In that way the sovereign debt can
be perpetually rolled over, and, without disruption, the required amount
of money created grows exponentially.</p>
<h1
id="reflections-of-the-origin-and-avoidance-of-the-strategems">Reflections
of the origin and avoidance of the strategems</h1>
<p>Many of the aforementioned strategems involve securing ‘free’ loans
from the Eurosystem, followed by de facto default: With infinite time
horizons and for practical purposes, repaying the collateral and
compounded interest becomes illusory. Moreover, if the interest rate is
effectively zero, the constraints on purchasing equity are primarily
determined by the (im)possibility of concealing such transactions from
public scrutiny. In the (unrealistic) limit, it would be theoretically
possible to acquire ‘everything for nothing’.</p>
<p>The viability of these strategies relies on the utilization of
non-physical fiat currencies, in contrast to those backed by a limited
medium of exchange, such as gold, silver, or algorithmically secured
‘hard’ currencies. I do not aim to dispute the advantages of fiat money
in general, since I believe that only fiat currency can provide the
necessary adaptability to meet the requirements of emerging technologies
and an expanding economy. However, the intangible nature of fiat
currencies makes them vulnerable to manipulation, resulting in
unintended wealth redistribution and concentration, as exemplified by
the Free Rider Problem <span class="citation"
data-cites="Congdon2022Mar"></span>. Consequently, it has been proposed
that “a new constitutional consensus for the EU, endowed with sound
economic foundations, is [[<span class="math inline">…</span>]
indispensable” <span class="citation"
data-cites="ojeda-2022"></span>.</p>
<p>Even if money creation is executed in large quantities, it does not
necessarily lead to ‘excessive’ (more than of the order of 100% per
annum) inflation, regardless of the volume or quantity of money
aggregate and demand-pull inflation—too much money chasing too few
goods—might suggest <span class="citation"
data-cites="barth-1975"></span>, even if the possibility of
‘hoarding’—stashes of money stowed away somewhere and suddenly
released—is taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Because as long as this additional money does not show up at foreign
exchanges, competing against other currencies, it will not lead to
inflation <span class="citation" data-cites="sauer-2023"></span>. This
can, for instance, be corroborated by the Japanese example characterized
by trade surplus and internal debt <span class="citation"
data-cites="Werner2003May Werner2005Mar"></span>.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that, as long as the currency is in some way
‘demanded’ or ‘wanted’ in relation to other currencies—for example, due
to a trade surplus, or the demand for commodities, especially those
related to energy—there will be no excessive inflation. As a result, if
you hold a reserve currency (that is always ‘wanted’), you can print ‘as
much money as you want’, without causing excessive inflation.</p>
<p>The true nature of these alleged scenarios or strategems remains
ambiguous to external observers: are they the product of inadequate
design and unforeseen repercussions, or are they deliberately
coordinated by factions within or outside the Eurosystem to, for
instance, reassign wealth among member states <span class="citation"
data-cites="Congdon2022Mar"></span>? Regardless of whether the impetus
stems from systemic deficiencies or calculated maneuvers, the Eurosystem
demands <span class="citation" data-cites="ojeda-2022"></span> a
comprehensive overhaul.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>This paper has identified and analyzed six key strategies employed to
exploit the Eurosystem’s financial mechanisms, highlighting significant
vulnerabilities within the current structure. These strategies include
inflating TARGET balances, leveraging collateral swaps followed by
defaults, diluting self-imposed regulatory rules, issuing money through
Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA), acquisitions facilitated via the
Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA), and the perpetual (re)issuance
of sovereign bonds as collateral that, through ever increasing compound
interest, may enter an unsustainable regime.</p>
<p>The analysis highlights that these practices arise from either
unintended systemic vulnerabilities or deliberate opportunism within the
Eurosystem. The intangible nature of fiat currencies poses distinct
challenges and opportunities for debasement and resource reallocation,
which are amplified in a monetary union characterized by diverse
economic conditions. This emphasizes the necessity for comprehensive
reforms to address these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The Eurosystem’s current reporting procedures and lack of
transparency in tracking individual balances between National Central
Banks (NCBs) pose significant challenges. The irreversible nature of the
current TARGET balance reporting makes it impossible to reconstruct
detailed inter-NCB transactions, which is crucial for understanding and
mitigating potential defaults and their implications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the erosion of self-imposed regulations, including debt
ceilings and collateral requirements, as well as the utilization of ELA
and ANFA, emphasizes the necessity for more stringent regulatory
structures and improved governance. The continuous (re)issuance of
sovereign bonds as collateral also highlights the systemic risks linked
to uncontrolled debt accumulation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Eurosystem’s vulnerabilities necessitate a
comprehensive overhaul to ensure financial stability and prevent
opportunistic exploitation. Only through robust reforms can the
Eurosystem address these challenges and ensure a more resilient and
transparent financial framework for all of its member states.</p>
