\@doendnote{endnote45}{ Other schemata to avoid the Kochen-Specker theorem such as Meyer's \cite {meyer:99} restrict the observables such that the construction of inconsistent schemata of interlinked contexts is no more possible. Still other schemata \cite {svozil-2003-garda} deny the existence of even this restricted set of contexts by maintaining that an $n$-ary quantum system is only capable of storing exactly one nit of quantum information. Thereby only a single context appears relevant; e.g., the context associated with the particular basis of $n$-dimensional Hilbert space in which this nit is encoded.}

\@doendnote{endnote47}{ A Greechie diagram consists of {\protect \em  points} which symbolize observables (representable by the spans of vectors in $n$-dimensional Hilbert space). Any $n$ points belonging to a maximal set of comeasurable observables (representable as some orthonormal basis of $n$-dimensional Hilbert space) are connected by {\protect \em  smooth curves}. Two smooth curves are crossing in a common link observable. In three dimensions, smooth curves and the associated points stand for tripods. }
