<!-- l. 487 --><p class='noindent'>At this point, I would like to thank the ancien régime of my
university, which left no stone unturned—almost lovingly—in
detail to dismiss their “elders”, and thus me; and the European
Court of Justice, which in its decision clearly stated that it is
perfectly acceptable in the EU area to discriminate against older
people [ECJ judgment of 21.07.2011—joined cases C-159/10
(Fuchs) and C-160/10 (Köhler)], even contrary to EU Directive
2000/78/EC regarding the prohibition of discrimination on
grounds of age: I was sent into compulsory retirement by
both.
</p><!-- l. 489 --><p class='indent'>   In contrast, my colleagues, for example in the USA, New
Zealand, and elsewhere, are not forced into retirement but can
continue to research and teach without restriction at their
universities. But they must or should do so! For had the authorities
not collectively banished me to retirement, I would probably not
have had the opportunity to travel to Polynesia, but would still be
teaching mathematical methods of theoretical physics in cold
countries in the lecture hall!
</p><!-- l. 491 --><p class='indent'>   So I owe it to my former rector and the European high court
judges that I was able to get to know this beautiful spot on Earth.
Albert Camus spoke of the absurd freedom that I now enjoy,
whether I like it or not.
